<p class='c005'>Know you what it is to be a child? It is to be something very
different from the man of to-day. It is to have a spirit yet streaming
from the waters of baptism; it is to believe in love, to believe in
loveliness, to believe in belief; it is to be so little that the elves can
reach to whisper in your ear; it is to turn pumpkins into coaches, and
mice into horses, lowness into loftiness, and nothing into everything,
for each child has its fairy godmother in its own soul; it is to live in
a nutshell and to count yourself the king of infinite space; it is</p>

<p class='c010'>All night the big liner had been plunging heavily,
but towards morning she entered quieter water, and
when the passengers woke, her rising and falling over
the great swells was so easy that even the sea-sick
women admitted the relief.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Land in sight, sir! We shall see Liverpool
within twenty hours now, barring fog.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The friendly bathroom steward passed the open
door of Stateroom No. 28, and the big, brown-bearded
man in the blue serge suit who was sitting,
already dressed, on the edge of the port-hole berth,
started as though he had been shot, and ran up on
deck without waiting to finish tying the laces of his
india-rubber shoes.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘By Jove!’ he said, as he thundered along the
stuffy passages of the rolling vessel, and ‘By Gad!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He emerged on the upper deck in the sunlight,
having nearly injured several persons in his impetuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>journey, and, taking a great gulp of the salt air with
keen satisfaction, he crossed to the side in a couple
of strides, the shoe-laces clicking against the deck
as he went.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Twenty years ago,’ he muttered, ‘when I was
barely out of my teens. And now——!’</p>

<p class='c011'>The big man was distinctly excited, though
‘moved’ perhaps is the better word, seeing that the
emotion was a little too searching, too tinged with
sadness, to include elation. He plunged both hands
into his coat pockets with a violence that threatened
to tear the bottoms out, and leaned over the railing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Far away a faint blue line, tinged delicately with
green, rose out of the sea. He saw it instantly, and
his throat tightened unexpectedly, almost like a
reflex action. For, about that simple little blue line
on the distant horizon there was something strangely
seizing, something absolutely arresting. The sight
of it was a hundred times more poignant than he had
imagined it would be; it touched a thousand springs
of secret life in him, and a mist rose faintly before
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul Rivers had not realised that his emotion
would be so intense; but from that instant everything
on the ship, otherwise familiar and rather
boring, looked different. A new sense of locality
came to him. The steamer became strange and
new; he ‘recognised’ bits of it as though he had
just come aboard a ship known aforetime. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>no longer the steamer that was merely crossing the
Atlantic; it was the boat that was bringing him
home. And there, trimming the horizon in a thin
ribbon of most arresting beauty, was the coast-line
of the first Island.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But it seems so much more solid—and so much
more real than I expected!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Though it was barely seven o’clock a few early
passengers were already astir, and he made his way
back again to the lower deck and thence climbed up
into the bows. He wished to be alone. Another
man, apparently from the steerage, was there before
him, leaning over the rail and peering fixedly under
one hand at the horizon. The saloon passenger
took up his position a few feet farther on and stared
hard. He, too, stared with the eyes of memory, now
grown a little dim. The air was fresh and sweet,
fragrant of long sea distances; there was a soft
warmth in it too, for it was late April and the spring
made its presence known even on the great waters
where there was nothing to hang its fairy banners on.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So that’s land! That’s the Old Country!’</p>

<p class='c011'>The words dropped out of their own accord; he
could not help himself. The sky seemed to come
down a little closer, with a more familiar and friendly
touch; the very air, he fancied, had a new taste in
it,—a whiff of his boyhood days—a smell of childhood
and the things of childhood—ages ago, it
seemed, in another life.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>The huge ship rose and fell on the regular, sweeping
swells, and sea-birds from the land already came
out to meet her. He easily imagined that the
thrills in the depths of his own being somehow
communicated themselves to the mighty vessel that
tore the seas asunder in her great desire to reach
the land.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Twenty years,’ he repeated aloud, oblivious of
his neighbour, ‘twenty years since I last saw it!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And it’s gol-darned nearer fifty since <em>I</em> seen it,’
exclaimed a harsh voice just behind him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned with a start. The steerage passenger
beside him, he saw, was an old man with a rough,
grey face, and hair turning white; the hand that
shaded his eyes was thick and worn; there was
a heavy gold ring on the little finger, and the dirty
cuff of a dark flannel shirt tumbled, loosely and unbuttoned,
over the very solid wrist. The face, he
noticed, at a second glance, was rugged, beaten,
scored, the face of a man who had tumbled terribly
about life, battered from pillar to post; and it was
only the light in the hard blue eyes—eyes still fixed
unwaveringly on the distant line of the land—that
redeemed it from a kind of grim savagery. Beaten
and battered, yes! Yet at the same time triumphant.
The atmosphere of the man proclaimed in some
vibrant fashion beyond analysis that he had failed in
all he undertook—failed from stupidity rather than
character, and always doggedly beginning over again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>with the same lack of intelligence—but yet had never
given in, and never would give in.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not difficult to reconstruct his history from
his appearance; or to realise his feelings as he saw
the Old Country after fifty years—a returned failure.
Although the voice had vibrated with emotion, the
face remained expressionless and unmoved; but
down both cheeks large tears ran slowly, in sudden
jerks, to drop with a splash upon the railing. And
Paul Rivers, after his intuitive fashion, grasped the
whole drama of the man with a sudden completeness
that touched him with swift sympathy. At the
same time he could not help thinking of rain-drops
running down the face of a statue. He recognised
with shame that he was conscious of a desire to
laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Fifty years! That’s a long time indeed,’ he said
kindly. ‘It’s half-a-century.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s so, Boss,’ returned the other in a dead
voice that betrayed Ireland overlaid with acquired
American twang and intonation; ‘and I guess now
I’ll never be able to stick it over here. Jest see it—and
then git back again.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He kept his eyes fixed on the horizon, and never
once turned his head towards the man he was speaking
to; only his lips moved; he did not even lift
a finger to brush off the great tears that fell one by
one from his cheeks to the deck. He seemed unconscious
of them; as though it was so long since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>those hard eyes had melted that they had forgotten
how to do it properly and the skin no longer
registered the sensation of the trickling. The tears
continued to fall at intervals; Paul Rivers actually
heard them splash.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I went out steerage,’ the man continued to himself,
or to the sea, or to any one else who cared
to listen, ‘and I come back steerage. That’s my
trouble. And now’—his eye shifted for a fraction
of a second and watched a huge wave go thundering
by—‘I’m grave-huntin’, I guess. And that’s about
the size of it. Jest see it and—git back again!’</p>

<p class='c011'>The first-class passenger made some kind and
appropriate reply—words with genuine sympathy in
them—and then, getting no further answer, found
it difficult to continue the conversation. The man,
he realised, had only wanted a peg to hang his
emotion on. It had to be a living peg, but any
other living peg would do equally well, and before
long he would find some one in the steerage who
would listen with delight to the flood that was bound
to come. And, presently, he took his departure to
his own quarters where the sailors, with bare feet,
were still swabbing the slippery decks.</p>

<p class='c011'>A couple of hours later, after breakfast, he leaned
over the rail and again saw the man on the steerage
deck, and heard him talking volubly. The tears
were gone, but the smudges were still visible on the
cheeks, where they had traced a zigzag pattern. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>was telling the history of his fifty years’ disappointments
and failures to one and all who cared to
listen.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, apparently, many cared to listen. The
man’s emotion was real; it found vigorous expression.
The sight of the old, loved shore, not seen
for half-a-century, but the subject of ten thousand
yearnings, had been too much for him. He told in
detail the substance of these ten thousand dreams—ever
one and the same dream, of course—and in the
telling of it he found the relief his soul sought. He
got it all out; it did him a world of good, saving
his inner being from a whole army of severe mental
fevers and spiritual pains. The man revelled in
a delirium of self-expression, and in so doing found
sanity and health for his overburdened soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the picture of that hard-faced old man
crying accompanied Paul Rivers to the upper decks,
and remained insistently with him for a long time.
It portrayed with such neat emphasis precisely what
was so deplorably lacking in his own character.
There, in concrete form, though not precisely his
own case, still near enough to be extremely illuminating,
he had seen a grown-up man finding abundant
and natural expression for his emotion. The man
was not ashamed of his tears, and would doubtless
have let them splash on the deck before a hundred
passengers, whereas he, Paul Rivers, was, it seemed,
constitutionally unable to reveal himself, to tell his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>deep longings, to find expression through any sensible
medium for the ten thousand dreams that choked his
life to the brim. He was unable, perhaps ashamed,
to splash on the deck.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not that the big, bronzed Englishman
wanted to cry, or to wash his soul in sentiment, but
that the sight of this old man’s passion, and its frank
and easy utterance, touched with dramatic intensity
the crying need of his whole temperament. The
need of the steerage passenger was the need of
a moment; his own was the need of an existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Lucky devil!’ he exclaimed, half laughing, half
sighing, as he went to his cabin for the field-glasses;
‘he knows how to get it out—and does get it out!
while I—with my impossible yearnings and my
absurd diffidence in speaking of them to others—I
haven’t got a single safety-valve of any sort or kind.
I can’t get it out of me—all this ocean in my heart
and soul—not a drop, not even a blessed tear!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed again and, stooping to pick up the
glasses, he caught a glimpse of his sunburned,
bearded face in the cabin mirror.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Even my appearance is against me,’ he went on
with mournful humour; ‘I look like a healthy
lumberman more than anything else in God’s world!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He bent forward and examined himself carefully
in detail.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What has such a face as that to do with
beauty, and the stars, and the moon sinking over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>a summer sea, or those night-winds I know rising
faintly from their hiding-places in the dim forests
and stealing on soft tiptoe about the sleeping world
until the dawn gives them leave to run and sing?
Yet <em>I</em> know—though I can never tell it to another—what
so many do not know! Who could ever
believe that <em>that</em> man’—he pointed to himself in the
glass, laughing—‘wants above all else in life, above
wealth, fame, success, the knowledge of spiritual
things, which is Reality—which is God?’</p>

<p class='c011'>A flash of light from nowhere ran over his face,
making it for one instant like the face of a boy,
shining, wonderful, radiantly young.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>I</em> know, for instance,’ he went on, the strange
flush of enthusiasm rising into his eyes, ‘that the
pine trees hold wind in their arms as cups hold rare
wine, and that when it spills I hear the exquisite
trickling of its music—but I can’t tell any one <em>that</em>!
And I can’t even put the wild magic of it into verse
or music. Or even into conduct,’ he concluded with
a laugh, ‘conduct that’s sane, that is. For, if I
could, I should find what I’m for ever seeking
behind all life and behind all expressions of beauty—I
should find the Reality I seek!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’ve no safety-valves,’ he added, swinging the
glasses round by their strap to the imminent danger
of various articles of furniture, ‘that’s the long and
short of it. Like a giraffe that can’t make any
sound at all although it has the longest throat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>in all creation. Everything in me accumulates and
accumulates. If only’—and the strange light came
back for a second to his brown eyes—‘I could write,
or sing, or pray—live as the saints did, or do something
to—to express adequately the sense of beauty
and wonder and delight that lives, like the presence
of a God, in my soul!’</p>

<p class='c011'>The lamp in his eyes faded slowly and he sat
back on the little cabin sofa, screwing and unscrewing
his glasses till it was surprising that the thread
didn’t wear out. And as he screwed, a hundred
fugitive pictures passed thronging through his mind;
moments of yearning and of pain, of sudden happiness
and of equally sudden despondency, vivid moods
of all kinds provoked by the smallest imaginable
fancies, as the way ever was with him. For the
moods of the sky were his moods; the swift,
coloured changes of sea and cloud were mirrored
in his heart as with all too impressionable people,
and he was for ever trying to seize the secret of their
loveliness and to give it form—in vain. Like many
another mystical soul he saw the invisible foundations
of the visible world—longed to communicate it to
others—found he couldn’t—then suffered all the
pain and fever of repression that seeks in vain for
adequate utterance. Too shy to stammer his profound
yearnings to ears that would not hear, and,
never having known the blessed relief of a sympathetic
audience, he perforce remained choked and dumb,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the only mitigation he knew being that loss of self
which follows prolonged contemplation. In his contemplation
of Nature, for instance, he would gaze
upon the landscape, the sky, a tree or flower, until
their essential beauty passed into his own nature.
For the moment he <em>felt with</em> these things. He <em>was</em>
them. He took their qualities literally into himself.
He lost his ordinary personality by changing its
centre, merging it into those remoter phases of consciousness
which extended from himself mysteriously
to include the landscape, the sky, the tree, the flower.</p>

<p class='c011'>For him everywhere in Nature there was psychic
energy. And it was difficult to say which was with
him the master passion: to find Reality—God—through
Nature, or to explain Nature through God.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the busy faces of America, now left behind
after twenty years, gradually receded, and others,
dimly seen through mist, rose above the horizon of
his thoughts. And among them he saw that two
stood forth with more clearness than the rest. One
of these was Dick Messenger, the friend of his boyhood,
now dead but a few years; and the other, the
face of his sister, Margaret, whom Dick had left a
widow, and whose children he would now see for
the first time at their country home in the South of
England.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ‘Old Country!’ He repeated the words
softly to himself, weaving it like a coloured thread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>through all his reverie. He had lived away
long enough to understand the poignant magic that
lies in the little phrase, and to appreciate the seizing
and pathetic beauty lying along that faint blue line
of sea and sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>And presently he took his field-glasses again and
went up on deck and hid himself in the bows alone.
Leaning over the bulwarks he took the scented wind
of spring full in the face, and watched with a curious
exhilaration the huge rollers, charging and bellowing
like wild bulls of the sea as the ship drew nearer and
nearer to the coast, plunging, leaping, and thundering
as she moved.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Justice is not done to the versatility and the unplumbed childishness
of man’s imagination. His life from without may seem but a rude
mound of mud, there will be some golden chamber at the heart of it,
in which he dwells delighted; and for as dark as his pathway seems to
the observer, he will have some kind of a bull’s-eye at his belt.—R. L. S.</p>

<p class='c010'>The case of Paul Rivers after all was very simple,
though perhaps in some respects uncommon.
Circumstances—to sum it up roughly—had so
conspired that the most impressionable portion of
his character—half of his mind and most of his
soul, that is—had never found utterance. He had
never discovered the medium that could carry forth
into the relief of expression all the inner turmoil
and delight of a soul that was very much alive and
singularly in touch with the simple and primitive
forces of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not, as with the returned emigrant, grief
that he felt, but something far more troublesome:
Joy. For the beauty of the world, of character
as of nature, laid a spell upon him that set his heart
in the glow and fever of an inner furnace, while
the play of his imagination among the ‘common’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>things of life which the rest of the world apparently
thought dull set him often upon the borders of an
ecstasy whereof he found himself unable to communicate
one single letter to his fellow-beings.
Thus, in later years, and out of due season, he was
afflicted and perplexed by a luxuriant growth that
by rights should have been harvested before he was
twenty-five; and a great part of him had neglected
to grow up at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>This result was due to no fault—no neglect, that
is—of his own, but to circumstances and temperament
combined. It explains, however, why, after
twenty years in the backwoods of America, he saw
the coast of the Old Country with a deep emotion
that was not all delight, but held something also of
dismay.</p>

<p class='c011'>Left an orphan, with his younger sister, at an
early age, the blundering of trustees had forced him
out into the world before his first term at Cambridge
was over, and after various vicissitudes he had found
his way to America and had been drawn into the
lumber trade. Here his knowledge and love of
trees—it was a veritable passion with him—soon
resulted in a transfer from the Minneapolis office
to the woods, and after an interesting apprenticeship,
he came to hold an important post in which he
was strangely at home. He was appointed to the
post of ‘Wood Cruiser’—forest-traveller, <i><span lang="fr">commis
voyageur</span></i> of the primeval woods. His duties, well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>paid too, were to survey, judge, mark, and report
upon the qualities and values of the immense timber
limits owned by his Company. And he loved the
work. It was a life of solitude, but a life close to
Nature; borne in his canoe down swift wilderness
streams; meeting the wild animals in their secret
haunts; becoming intimate with dawns and sunsets,
great winds, the magic of storms and stars, and
being initiated into the profound mysteries of the
clean and haunted regions of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the effect of this kind of life upon him—especially
at an age when most men are busy
learning more common values in the strife of cities—was
of course significant. For here, in this solitary
existence, the beauty of the world, virgin and
glorious, struck the eyes of his soul and nearly
blinded them.</p>

<p class='c011'>His whole being threw itself inwards upon his
thoughts, and outwards upon what fed his thoughts—the
wonder of Nature. Even as a boy he had
been mystically minded, a poet if ever there was
one, though a poet without a lyre; but at school he
had chanced to come under the influence of masters
who had sought to curb the exuberance of his
imagination, so that he started into life with the
rooted idea that it was something of a disgrace for
a man to be too sensitive to beauty, and to possess
a vivid and coloured imagination was almost a thing
to be ashamed of.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>This view of his only ‘silver talent,’ moreover,
was never permitted by the nature of his life to alter.
His early American experiences stiffened it into a
conviction which he yet despised. The fires ran
hidden, if unchecked. Had he dwelt in cities, they
might have suffered total extinction perhaps, but
here, in the heart of the free woods, they speedily
rose to the surface again and flamed. He grew up
singularly unspoilt, the shyness of the original nature
utterly uncorrected, the stores of a poetic imagination
accumulating steadily, but always unuttered.</p>

<p class='c011'>For his sole companions all these years when he
had any at all were the ‘Bosses’ of the lumber
camps he inspected, the ‘Cookee’ who looked after
his stew-pot in the ‘home-shack,’ and the half-breed
Indian who accompanied him in the stern-seat of
the bark canoe during the month-long trips about
the wilderness: these—with the animals, winds, stars,
and the forms of beauty his imagination for ever
conjured out of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>For twenty years he lived thus, knowing all the
secrets of the woods and streams. In the summer
he never slept under cover at all, so that even in
sleep he understood, through closed eyelids, the
motions of the stars behind the tangled network of
branches overhead. In winter his snow-shoes carried
him into the heart of the most dazzling scenes
imaginable—the forest lying under many feet of
snow with a cloudless sun lifting it all into an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>appearance of magic that took the breath away.
Moreover, the fierce spring, when the streams became
impassable floods, and the autumn, with a flaming
glory of gold and scarlet unknown anywhere else
in the world, he knew as intimately as the dryads
themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>And all these moods became the intimate companions
of his life, taking the place of men and
women. He came to personify Nature as a matter
of course.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without knowing it, too, the place of children
was taken somehow by the wild animals. He knew
them all. He surprised them in their haunts in
the course of his silent journeys into the heart of
their playgrounds; and his headquarters—a one-story
shanty on the height of land between his
two chief ‘limits’—was never without a tamed baby
bear, a young moose to draw him on his snow-shoes
with the manners of a well-bred pony, and a dozen
other animals reclaimed from savagery and turned
by some mysterious system of his own into real
companions and confidants.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the only books he read in the long winter
nights, besides a few modern American novels that
puzzled and vaguely distressed him, were Blake, his
loved Greek plays, and the Bible.</p>

<p class='c011'>He rarely saw a woman. Sides of his nature that
ought to have developed under the influences of
normal life at home lay dormant altogether, or were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>filled as best might be by his intercourse with Nature.
He wrote few letters. After Dick Messenger died,
the formal correspondence he kept up at long
intervals with his sister—Dick’s widow—hardly deserved
the name of letters. Great slabs of him, so
to speak, stopped growing up, sinking down into the
subconscious region to await conditions favourable
for calling them to the surface again, and eventually
coming to life—this was his tragic little secret—at
a time when they were long overdue.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the end of life he remained shy, shy in the
sense that most of his thoughts and emotions he was
afraid to reveal to others; with the shyness, too, of the
utterly modest soul that cannot believe the world will
give it the very things it has most right to claim, yet
never dares to claim. And to the end Nature never
lifted the spell laid upon him during those twenty
years of initiation in her solitudes. To see the new
moon tilting her silver horns in the west; to hear
the wind rustling in high trees, like old Indians
telling one another secrets of the early world; and
to see the first stars looking down from the height
of sky through spaces of watery blue—these, and a
hundred other things that the majority seemed to
ignore, were to him a more moving and terrible
delight than anything he could imagine. For him
such things could never be explained away, but
remained living and uncorrected to the end.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus when, at forty-five, he inherited the fortune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of his aunt (which he had always known must one
day come to him), he returned to England with the
shy, bursting, dream-laden heart of a boy, young
as only those are young whom life has kept clean
and sweet in the wilderness; and the question that
sprang to life in his heart when he saw the blue line
of coast was a vague wonder as to what would become
of his full-blooded dreams when tested by the
conventional English life that he remembered as a
boy. To whom could he speak of his childlike
yearning after God; of his swift divinations, his
passionate intuitions into the very things that the
majority put away with childhood? What modern
priest—so he felt, at least—what befuddled mystic,
could possibly enter into the essential nature of these
cravings as he did, or understand, without a sneer,
the unspoilt passions of a man who had never
‘grown up’?</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I shall be out of touch with it all,’ he thought
as he stood there in the bows and watched the
blue line grow nearer, ‘utterly out of touch. What
shall I find to say to the men of my own age—I,
who stopped growing up twenty years ago? How
shall I ever link on with them? Children are the
only things I can talk to, and children!’—he
shrugged his shoulders and laughed—‘children will
find me out at once and give me away to the others.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Dick’s children, though, may be different!’ came
the sudden reflection. ‘Only—I’ve had nothing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>do with children for such ages. Dick had real
imagination. By George,’—and his eyes glowed
a moment—‘what if they took after him!’</p>

<p class='c011'>And for the fiftieth time, as he pictured the
meeting with his stranger sister, his heart sank, and
he found refuge in the knowledge that he had not
altogether burned his boats behind him. For he
had been wise in his generation. He had arranged
with his Company, who were only too glad of the
chance of keeping his services, that he should go to
England on a year’s leave, and that if in the end he
decided to return he should have a share in the
business, while still continuing the work of forest-inspection
that he loved.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m nothing but a wood cruiser. I shall go
back. In the big world I might lose all my vision!’</p>

<p class='c011'>And, having lived so long out of the world, he
now came back to it with this simple, innocent,
imaginative heart of a great boy, a boy still dreaming,
for all his five-and-forty years. Fully realising
that something was wrong with him, that he ought
to be more sedate, more cynical, more prosaic and
sober, he yet could not quite explain to himself
wherein lay the source of his disability. His
thoughts stumbled and blundered when he tried
to lay his finger on it, with the only result that he
felt he would be ‘out of touch’ with his new world,
not knowing exactly how or why.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s a regular log-jam,’ he said, using the phraseology
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>he was accustomed to, ‘and I’m sorry for the
chap that breaks it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It never occurred to him that in this simple thrill
that Nature still gave him he possessed one of the
greatest secrets for the preservation of genuine
youth; indeed, had he understood this, it would
have meant that he was already old. For with the
majority such dreams die young, brushed rudely from
the soul by the iron hand of experience, whereas in
his case it was their persistent survival that lent such
a childlike quality to his shyness, and made him
secretly ashamed of not feeling as grown up as he
realised he ought to feel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul Rivers, in a word, belonged to a comprehensible
though perhaps not over common type,
and one not often recognised owing to the elaborate
care with which its ‘specimens’ conceal themselves
from the world under all manner of brave disguises.
He was destitute of that nameless quality that constitutes
a human being, not mature necessarily, but
grown up. Sources of inner enthusiasm that most
men lose when life brings to them the fruit of the
Tree of Good and Evil, had kept alive; and though
on the one hand he was secretly ashamed of the
very simplicity of his great delights, on the other
hand he longed intensely for some means by which
he could express them and relieve his burdened soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>He envied the emigrant who could let fall hot
tears on the deck without further ado, while at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>same time he dreaded the laughter of the world into
which he was about to move when they learned the
cause of the emotions that produced them. A boy
at forty-five! A dreamer of children’s dreams with
fifty in sight—and no practical results!</p>

<p class='c011'>These were some of the thoughts still tumbling
vaguely about his mind when the tug brought letters
aboard at Queenstown, and on the dining-room table
where they were spread out he found one for himself
in a handwriting that he both welcomed and dreaded.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He welcomed it, because for years it had been the
one remaining link with the life of his old home—these
formal epistles that reached him at long
intervals; and he dreaded it, because he knew it
would contain a definite invitation of an embarrassing
description.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘She’s bound to ask me,’ he reflected as he
opened it in his cabin; ‘she can’t help herself. And
I am bound to accept, for I can’t help myself
either.’ He was far too honest to think of inventing
elaborate excuses. ‘I’ve got to go and
spend a month with her right away whether I like
it or not.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not by any means that he disliked his
sister, for indeed he hardly knew her; after all
these years he barely remembered what she looked
like, the slim girl of eighteen he had left behind.
It was simply that in his mind she stood for the
conventional life, so alien to his vision, to which
he had returned.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would try to like her, certainly. Very warm
impulses stirred in his heart as he thought of her—his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>only near relative in the world, and the widow
of his old school and Cambridge friend, Dick
Messenger. It was in her handwriting that he
first learned of Dick’s love for her, as it was in
hers that the news of his friend’s death reached
him—after his long tour—two months old. The
handwriting was a symbol of the deepest human
emotions he had known. And for that reason, too,
he dreaded it.</p>

<p class='c011'>He never realised quite what kind of woman
she had become; in his thoughts she had always
remained simply the girl of eighteen—grown up—married.
Her letters had been very kind and
gentle, if in the nature of the case more and more
formal. She became shadowy and vague in his
mind as the years passed, and more and more he
had come to think of her as wholly out of his own
world. Reading between the lines it was not difficult
to see that she attached importance to much
in life that seemed to him unreal and trivial, whereas
the things that he thought vital she never referred
to at all. It might, of course, be merely restraint
concealing great depths. He could not tell. The
letters, after a few years, had become like formal
government reports. He had written fully, however,
to announce his home-coming, and her reply
had been full of genuine pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I don’t think she’ll make very much of me,’
was the thought in his mind whenever he dwelt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>upon it. ‘I’m afraid my world must seem foreign—unreal
to her; the things I know rubbish.’</p>

<p class='c011'>So, in the privacy of his cabin, his heart already
strangely astir by the emotion of that blue line
on the horizon, he read his sister’s invitation and
found it charming. There was spontaneous affection
in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We shall fix things up between us so that no
one would ever know.’ He did not explain what
it was ‘no one would ever know,’ but went on
to finish the letter. He was to make his home with
her in the country, he read, until he decided what
to do with himself. The tone of the letter made
his heart bound. It was a real welcome, and he
responded to it instantly like a boy. Only one
thing in it seriously disturbed his equanimity.
Absurd as it may seem, the fact that his sister’s
welcome included also that of the children, had a
subtly disquieting effect upon him.</p>

<p class='c013'>... for they are dying to see you and to find out for
themselves what the big old uncle they have heard so much
about is really like. All their animals are being cleaned
and swept so as to be ready for your arrival, and, in anticipation
of your stories of the backwoods, no other tales find
favour with them any more.</p>

<p class='c011'>An expression of perplexity puckered his face.
‘I declare, I’m afraid of those children—Dick’s
children!’ he thought, holding the open letter to
his mouth and squinting down the page, while his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>eyebrows rose and his forehead broke into lines.
‘They’ll find out what I am. They’ll betray me.
I shall never be able to hold out against them.’
He knew only too well how searching was the appeal
that all growing and immature life made to him.
It touched the very centre of him that had refused
to grow up and that made him young with itself.
‘I can no more resist them than I could resist the
baby bears, or that little lynx that used to eat out
of my hand.’ He shrugged his big shoulders, looking
genuinely distressed. ‘And then every one will
know what I am—an overgrown boy—a dumb poet—a
dreamer of dreams that bear no fruit!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He was not morbidly introspective. He was
merely trying to face the little problem squarely.
He got up and staggered across the cabin, steadying
himself against the rolling of the ship in front of
the looking-glass.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Big Old Uncle!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He stuffed the letter into his pocket and surveyed
himself critically. Big he certainly was, but that
other adjective brought with it a sensation of
weariness that had never yet troubled him in his
wilderness existence. He was only a little, just a
very little, on the shady side of forty-five, but to
the children he might seem really old, <em>aged</em>, and
to his sister, who was considerably his junior, as
elderly, and perhaps in need of the comforts of the
elderly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>He squared his shoulders and looked more closely
into the glass. There, opposite to him, stood a tall,
dignified man in a blue suit, with a spotless linen
collar and a neat tie passing through a gold ring, instead
of the unkempt fellow he was accustomed to in
a flannel shirt, red handkerchief and big sombrero hat
pulled over his eyes; a man weighing the best part
of fifteen stones, lean, well-knit, vigorous, and nearly
six feet three in his socks. A pair of brown eyes,
kindly brown eyes he thought, met his own questioningly,
and a brown beard—yes, it was still brown—covered
the lower part of the face. He put up a
hand to stroke it, and noticed that it was a strong,
muscular hand, sunburnt but well kept, with neat
finger-nails, and a heavy signet ring on one finger.
It brushed across the rather deep lines on the
bronzed forehead, without brushing them away,
however, and then travelled higher to the rough
parting in the dark-brown hair, and the hair, he
noticed, was brushed in a particular way evidently,
a way he thought no one would notice but himself
and the lumber-camp barber who first taught him,
so as to cover up a few places where the wind made
little chilly feelings in winter-time under his fur
cap.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old? No, not old yet—but “getting on” was
a gentler phrase he could not deny, and there were
certainly odd traces where the crows had walked
on his skin while he slept in the forest, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>hopped up even to the corners of his eyes to see if
he were really asleep. There were other lines, too—lines
of exposure, traced by wind and sun, and
one or two queer marks that are said only to come
from prolonged hardship and severest want. For
he had known both sides of the wilderness life, and
on his long journeys Nature had not always been
kind to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He stared for a long time at his reflection in
the glass, lost in reverie. This coming back to
England after so many years was like looking at
a picture of himself as he was when he had left;
it furnished him with a ready standard of comparison;
the changes of the years stood out very
sharply, as though they had come about in a single
night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, his face and figure had aged a good deal.
He admitted it. And when he frowned he had
distinctly an appearance of middle age. This, of
course, was the absurd part of it, for in spirit he
had remained as young as he was at twenty, as
enthusiastic, hopeful, spontaneous as ever, just as
much in love with the world, and just as full of
boyhood’s dreams as when he went to Cambridge.
And in his eyes still burned the strange flames that
sought to pierce behind the veil of appearances.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And those children will find it out and make me
look ridiculous before I’ve been there a week!’ he
exclaimed again, sitting down on his bunk with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>crash as the steamer gave a sudden lurch; ‘and then
where shall I be, I’d like to know?’</p>

<p class='c011'>He lay on his back for an hour thinking out a
plan of action. For, of course, he decided that he
must go; only—he must go <em>disguised</em>. And he
spent hours inventing the disguise, and more hours
perfecting it. For the first time in his life he would
adopt a distinct attitude, and, having carefully thought
out the attitude he intended to adopt by way of
disguise, he buckled it on like armour and fastened
it very securely indeed to his large person.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would be kind; he would even meet the
children half-way, kiss them if necessary at stated
times, in a stated way, and perhaps occasionally unbend
a little as opportunity served and circumstances
permitted. But never must he forget, or allow them
to forget, that he was a stiff and elderly man, a little
grim and gruff, sometimes even severe and short-tempered,
and never to be trifled with at any time,
or under any conditions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over the tenderer emotions he must keep especial
watch; these were a direct channel to his secrets, and
once the old unsatisfied enthusiasms escaped, there
was no saying what might happen. The thought
frightened him, for the pain involved might be very
great indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>With people of his own age, he realised, the
danger would be less. Silence and reserve cover a
multitude of shortcomings. But children, he knew,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>had a simple audacity, a merciless penetration, that no
mere pose could ever withstand. And this he felt
intuitively, knowing nothing of children, but being
taught by these very qualities in himself. Like little
animals they would soon find the direct channel to
his heart unless well guarded, and come tumbling
along it without delay. And then——!</p>

<p class='c011'>So Paul Rivers left London the very next day,
glad in many ways to think that he had this haven of
refuge to go to from the noisy horror of the huge
strange city; yet with a sinking of his heart lest his
true self should be discovered, and held up to scorn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, the strange part of it was that as he
sped down through the smiling green country that
spring afternoon, armed from head to foot in the
rigid steel casings of his disguise, he seemed to hear
a faint singing deep within him, a singing that
belonged to the youngest part of him and yet sprang
from that which was vastly ancient, but as to the
cause of which he was so puzzled that, in his efforts
to analyse it, he forgot about his journey altogether,
and was nearly carried past the station where he had
to get out.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>No man worth his spiritual salt can ever become really entangled
in locality.—A. H. L.</p>

<p class='c010'>The house, like the description of himself in the
letter, was big and old. It consisted of three
rambling wings, each added at a different period to
an original farmhouse, and was thus full of unexpected
staircases, sudden rising passages, and rooms
of queer shapes. It resembled, indeed, the structure
of a mind that has grown by chance and not by
system, and was just as difficult for a stranger to
find his way in.</p>

<p class='c011'>It stood among pine-woods, at the foot of hills
that ran on another five miles to drop their chalk
cliffs abruptly into the sea. Where the lawns stopped
on one side and the kitchen-garden on the other
began an expanse of undulating heather-land, dotted
with pools of brown water and yellow with patches
of gorse and broom. Here rabbits increased and
multiplied; sea-gulls screamed and flew, using some
of the more secluded ponds for their annual breeding
places; foxes lived happily, unhunted and very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>bold; and the dainty hoof-marks of deer were
sometimes found in the sandy margins of the freshwater
springs.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was beautiful country, a bit of wild England,
out of the world as very few parts of it now are, and
haunted by a loveliness that laid its spell on the heart
of the returned exile the moment he topped the hill in
the dog-cart and saw it spread out before him like a
softly coloured map. The scenery from the train
window had somehow disheartened him a little,
producing a curious sense of confinement, almost
of imprisonment, in his mind: the neat meadows
holding wooden cattle; the careful boundaries of
ditch and hedge; the five-barred gates, strong to
enclose, the countless notices to warn trespassers, and
the universal network of barbed wire. Accustomed
as he was to the vast, unhedged landscapes of a primitive
country, it all looked to him, with its precise
divisions, like a toy garden, combed, washed, swept—exquisitely
cared for, but a little too sweet and perfumed
to be quite wholesome. Only tame things,
he felt, could enjoy so gentle a playground, and the
call of his own forests—for this really was what
worked in him—sang out to him with a sterner cry.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this view from the ridge pleased him more:
there were but few hedges visible; the eye was led
to an open horizon and the sea; an impression of
space and freedom rose from the hills and moorlands.
Here his thoughts, accustomed to deal with leagues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>rather than acres, could at least find room to turn
about in. And although the perfume that rose to
his nostrils was like the perfume of flowers preserved
by some artificial process rather than the
great clean smells of a virgin world such as he was
used to, it was nevertheless the smell of his boyhood,
and it moved him powerfully. Odour is the
one thing that is impossible to recall in exile. Sights
and sounds the imagination can always reconstruct
after a fashion, but odour is too elusive. It rose
now to his nostrils as something long forgotten,
and swept him with a wave of memory that was
extraordinarily keen.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s a smell to take me back twenty-five years,’
he thought, inhaling the scent of the heather. He
caught his breath sharply, uncertain whether it was
pain or pleasure that predominated. A profound
yearning, too fugitive to be seized, too vague to be
definitely labelled, stirred in the depths of him as
his eye roamed over the miles of sunlight and blue
shadow at his feet; again something sang within
him as he gazed over the long ridges of heathland,
sprinkled with silvery pools, and bearing soft purple
masses of pine-woods on their sides as they melted
away through haze to the summer sea beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only when his gaze fell upon the smoke rising
from the grey stone roof of the house nestling far
below did the joy of his emotion chill a little. A
vague sense of alarm and nervousness touched him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>as he wondered what that grey old building might
hold in store for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s silly, I know,’ his thought ran, ‘but I feel
like a lost sheep here. It’s Nature that calls me,
not people. I don’t know how I shall get on in this
chess-board sort of a country. They’ll never care
for the things that I care for.’</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment a sort of panic came over him.
He could almost have turned and run. Vaguely he
felt that he was an unfinished, uncouth article in a
shop of dainty china. He sent the dog-cart on
ahead, and walked down the hillside towards the
house, thinking, thinking—wondering almost why he
had ever consented to come, and already conscious of
a sense of imprisonment. He was still impressionable
as a boy, with sharp, fleeting moods like a boy’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, quite suddenly it seemed, he had walked
up the drive and passed through the house, and a
figure moved across a lawn to meet him. The first
sight of his sister he had known for twenty years was
a tall woman in white serge, with a prim, still girlish
figure and a quiet, smiling face, moving graciously
through patches of sunshine between flower-beds of
formal outline. There was no spontaneous rush of
welcome, no gush, or flood of questions. He felt
relieved. With a flash, too, he realised that her
dominant note was still grief for her lost husband.
It was written all over her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instantly, however, shyness descended upon him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>like a cloud. The scene he had rehearsed so often
in imagination vanished before the reality. He
slipped down inside himself, as his habit sometimes
was, and watched the performance curiously, as
though he were a spectator of it instead of an actor.</p>

<p class='c011'>He saw himself, hot and rather red in the face,
walking awkwardly across the lawn with both hands
out, offering his bearded face clumsily to be kissed.
And it was kissed, first on one cheek, then on the
other, calmly, soberly, delicately. He felt the tingling
of it for a long time afterwards. That kiss
confused him ridiculously.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first he could think of nothing to say except
the form of address he always used to the Bosses
of the lumber camps—‘How’s everything up your
way?’—which he felt was not quite the most suitable
phrase for the occasion. Then his sister spoke,
and quickly set him more at his ease.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But you don’t look one little bit like an
American, Paul!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He gazed at her in admiration, just as he might
have gazed at a complete stranger. The soft intonation
of her voice was a keen delight to him. And
her matter-of-fact speech put his shyness to flight.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course not,’ he replied, leaving out her name
after a second’s hesitation, ‘but my voice, I guess——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not a bit either,’ she repeated, surveying him
very critically. ‘You look like a sailor home from
the sea more than anything else.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>She wore a wide garden hat of Panama straw,
charmingly trimmed with flowers. Her face beneath
it, Paul thought, was the most refined and exquisitely
delicate he had ever seen. It was like chiselled
porcelain. He thought of Hank Davis’s woman
at Deep Bay Camp—whose face he used to think
wonderful rather—and it suddenly seemed by comparison
to have been chopped with a blunt axe out
of wood.</p>

<p class='c011'>They moved to the long chairs upon the lawn,
and her brother realised for the first time that his
boots were enormous, and that his Minneapolis clothes
did not sit upon him quite as they might have done.
He trod on a corner of a geranium bed as they went,
crushing an entire plant with one foot. But his
sister appeared not to notice it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s an awful long time, M—Margaret,’ he
stammered as they went.</p>

<p class='c011'>They both sat down and turned to stare at each
other. It was, of course, idle to pretend that after
so long an absence they could feel any very profound
affection. Dick, he realised quickly with a flash of
intuition, was the truer link. And, on the whole,
it was all much easier than he had expected. His
mind began to work very quickly in several directions
at once. The beauty of the English garden in
its quiet way touched him keenly, stirring in him
little whirls of inner delight, fugitive but wonderful.
Only a portion of him, after all, went out to his sister.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>‘I believe you expected a Red Indian, or a bear,’
he said at length.</p>

<p class='c011'>She laughed gently, returning his stare of genuine
admiration. ‘One couldn’t help wondering a little,
Paul dear,—after so many years—could one?’ She
always said ‘one’ instead of the obvious personal
pronoun. ‘You had no beard, for instance, when
you left?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And more hair, perhaps!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You look splendid. I <em>shall</em> be proud of
you!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul blushed furiously. It was the first compliment
ever paid to him by a woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, I feel all right,’ he stammered. ‘The
healthy life in the woods, open air, and constant
moving keep a fellow “fixed-up” to concert pitch
all the time. I’ve never once—consulted a doctor
in my life.’ He was careful to keep the slang out.
He felt he managed it admirably. He said ‘consulted.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And you wrote such nice letters, Paul. It <em>was</em>
dear of you.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I was lonely,’ he said bluntly. And after a
pause he added, ‘I got all yours.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m so glad.’ And then another pause. In
which fashion they talked on for half an hour, each
secretly estimating the other—wondering a little
why they did not feel all kind of poignant emotions
they had rather expected to feel.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>It was a perfectly natural scene between a brother
and sister who had grown up entirely apart, who
were quite honest, who were utterly different types,
and who yet wished to hold to one another as the
nearest blood ties they possessed. They skimmed
pleasantly and, so far as he was concerned, more and
more easily, over the surface of things. Her talk,
like her letters, was sincere, simple, shallow; it concealed
no hidden depths, he felt at once. And by
degrees, even in this first conversation, crept a
shadow of other things, so that he realised they were
in reality leagues apart, and could never have anything
much in common below the pleasant surface
relations of life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, even while he sheered off, as oil declines
from its very nature to mingle with water, he felt
genuinely drawn to her in another way. She was
his own sister; she was his nearest tie; and she was
Dick’s widow. They would get along together all
right; they would be good friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Twenty years, Margaret.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Twenty years, Paul.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And then another pause of several minutes during
which something that was too vague to be a real
thought passed like a shadow through his mind.
What could his friend Dick have seen in her
that was necessary to his life and happiness—Dick
Messenger, who was scholar, poet, thinker—who
sought the everlasting things—God? He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>instantly suppressed it as unworthy, something of
which he was ashamed, but not before it had left
a definite little trace in his imagination.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So at last, Paul, you’ve really come home,’ she
resumed; ‘I can hardly believe it,—and are going to
settle down. You are a rich man.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Aunt Alice did her duty,’ he laughed. He
ignored the reference to settling down. It vaguely
displeased him. ‘It’s for you as well as me,’ he
added, meaning the money. ‘I want to share with
you whatever you need.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not a penny,’ she said quickly; ‘I have all I
need. I live with my memories, you know. I am
only so glad for your sake,—after all your hard life
out there.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The life wasn’t hard; it was rather wonderful,’
he said simply. ‘I liked it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘For a time perhaps; but you must have had
curious experiences and lived with very rough
people in those—lumber camp places you wrote
about.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He shrugged his shoulders. ‘Simple kind of
men, but very decent, very genuine. Few signs of
city polish, I admit, but then you know I never
cared for frills, Margaret.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Frills!’ she exclaimed, without any expression
on her face. ‘Of course not. Still, I am very glad
you have left it all. The life must often have been
unsuitable and lonely; one always felt that for you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>You can’t have had any of the society that one’s
accustomed to.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not of that kind,’ he put in hurriedly with a
short laugh, ‘but of other kinds. I struck a pretty
good crowd of men on the whole.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned her face slightly away from him; her
eyes, he divined, had been fixed for a moment on his
hands. For the first time in his life he realised that
they were large and rough and brown. Her own
were so pale and dainty—like china hands, glossy
and smooth—and the gold bangle on her thin wrist
looked as though every second it must slip over her
fingers. His own hands disappeared swiftly into the
pockets of his coat.</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned to him with a gentle smile. ‘Anyhow,’
she said, ‘it is simply too delightful to know
that you really are here at last. It must seem strange
to you at first, and there are so many things to talk
over—such a lot to tell. I want to hear all your
plans. You’ll get used to us after a bit, and there
are lots of nice people in the neighbourhood who are
dying to meet you.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Her brother felt inclined to explain that he had
no wish to interfere with their ‘dying’; but, instead,
he returned her smile. ‘I’m a poor hand at meeting
people, I’m afraid,’ he said. ‘I’m not as sociable as
I might be.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But you’ll get over that. Of course, living
so long in the backwoods makes one unsociable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>But we’ll try and make you happy and comfortable.
You have no idea how very, very glad I am that
you’ve come home.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul believed her. He leaned over and patted
her hand, and she smiled frankly and sweetly in his
face. She was a very shadowy sort of personality,
he felt. If he blew hard she might blow away
altogether, or disappear like a soap-bubble.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m glad too, of course,’ he replied. ‘Only at
my age, you know, it’s not easy to tackle new
habits.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘No one could take you for a day more than
thirty-five,’ she said with truth; ‘so that shall be our
own little private secret. You look quite absurdly
young.’</p>

<p class='c011'>They laughed together easily and naturally. Paul
felt more at home and soothed than he had thought
possible. It had not been in the least formidable
after all, and for the first time in his life he knew
a little of that enervating kind of happiness that
comes from being made a fuss of. As there was
still a considerable interval before tea, they left their
chairs and strolled through the garden, and as they
went, the talk turned upon the past, and his sister
spoke of Dick and of all he had meant to do in the
world, had he lived. Paul heard the details of his
sudden death for the first time. Her voice and
manner were evidence of the melancholy she still
felt, but her brother’s heart was deeply stirred; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>asked for all the particulars he had so often wondered
about, and in her quiet, soothing tone, tinged now
with tender sadness, she supplied the information.
Clearly she had never arisen from the blow. She
had worshipped Dick without understanding him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Death always frightens me, I think,’ she said
with a faint smile. ‘I try not to think about it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She passed on to speak of the children, and told
him how difficult she found it to cope with them—she
suffered from frequent headaches and could not
endure noise—and how she hoped when they were
a little older to be more with them. Mademoiselle
Fleury, meanwhile, was such an excellent woman and
was teaching them all they should know.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Though, of course, I keep a close eye on them
so far as I am able,’ she explained, ‘and only wish
I were stronger.’</p>

<p class='c011'>They sauntered through the rose-garden and
down the neat gravel paths that led to the wilder
parts of the grounds where the rhododendron bushes
stood in rounded domes and masses. It was very
peaceful, very beautiful. He trod softly and carefully.
The hush of centuries of cultivation lay over
it all. Even the butterflies flew gently, as to the
measure of a leisurely dance that deprecated undue
animation. Paul caught his thoughts wandering to
the open spaces of untamed moorland he had seen
from the hill-top. More and more, as his sister’s
personality revealed itself, he got the impression that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>she lived enclosed like the wooden cows he had seen
from the train, in a little green field, with precise
and neatly trimmed borders. Strong emotions, as
all other symptoms of plain and vigorous life, she
shrank from. There were notice-boards set about
her to warn trespassers, stating clearly that she did
not wish to be let out. Yet in her way she was true,
loving, and sweet—only it was such a conventional
way, he felt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving the world of rhododendron bushes behind
them, they came to the beginning of a pine-wood
leading to the heather-land beyond. There was
a touch of primitive wildness here. The trees grew
straight and tall, filling the glade, and a stream ran
brawling among their roots.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This is the Gwyle,’ she said, as they entered the
shade, ‘it was Dick’s favourite part of the whole
grounds. I rarely come here; it’s dark even in
summer, and rather damp and draughty, I always
think.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul looked about him and drew a long breath.
The air was strong with open-air scents of earth and
bark and branches. Far overhead the tufted pines
swayed, murmuring to the sky; the ground ran
away downhill, becoming broken up and uneven;
nothing but dark, slender stems rose everywhere
about him, like giant seaweeds, he thought, rising
from the pools of a deep sea. And the soft wind,
moving mysteriously between the shadows and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>sunlight, completed the spell. He passed suddenly—willy-nilly,
as his nature would have it—into that
mood when the simplest things about him turned
their faces upwards so that he caught their eyes and
their meaning; when the well-known and common
things of the world shone out and revealed the
infinite. Something in this quiet pine-wood that
was mighty, and utterly wonderful, entered his soul,
linking him on at a single stroke with the majesty of
the great spirit of the earth. What lay behind it?
What was its informing spirit? How and where
could it link on so intimately with his soul? And
could it not be a channel, as he always felt it must
be, to the God behind it? Beauty seized him by
the throat and made him tremble.</p>

<p class='c011'>This sudden rush came over him, sea-like. His
moods were ever like the sea, some strange touch
of colour shifting the entire key. Something, too,
made him feel lonely and oppressed. He, who was
accustomed to space in bulk—the space the stars
and winds live in—had come to this little, parcelled-out
place. He felt clipped already. He turned to
the shadowy personality beside him, the boyish impulse
bursting its way out. After all, she was his
own sister; he could reveal himself to no one if not
to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘By Gosh, Margaret,’ he cried, ‘this is the real
thing. This wood must be alive and haunted just as
the James Bay forests are. It’s simply full of wonder.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>‘It’s the Gwyle wood,’ she said quietly. ‘It’s
usually rather damp. But Dick loved it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Her brother hardly heard what she said. ‘Listen,’
he said in a hushed tone; ‘do you hear the wind up
there aloft? The trees are talking. The wood is
full of whispers. There’s no sound in the world
like that murmur of a soft breeze in pine branches.
It’s like the old gods sighing, which only their
true worshippers hear! Isn’t it fine and melancholy?
Margaret, d’you know, it goes through
me like a fever.’</p>

<p class='c011'>His sister stopped and stared at him. She wore
a little frightened expression. His sudden enthusiasm
puzzled her evidently.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s the Gwyle wood,’ she repeated mechanically.
‘It’s very pretty, I think. Dick always thought
so too.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Her brother, surprised at his own rush of ready
words, and already ashamed of the impulse that
had prompted him to reveal himself, fell into
silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nature excites me sometimes,’ he said presently.
‘I suppose it’s because I’ve known nothing
else.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s quite natural, I’m sure, Paul dear,’ she
rejoined, turning to lead the way back to the sunshine
of the open garden; ‘it’s very pretty; I love
it too. But it rather alarms me, I think, sometimes.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>‘Perhaps the natural tendency in solitude is to
personify nature, and make it take the place of men
and women. It has become a profound need of my
being certainly.’ He spoke more quietly, chilled
by her utter absence of comprehension.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In its place I think it is ever so nice. But,
Paul, you surprise me. I had no idea you were
clever like that.’ She was perfectly sincere in what
she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her brother blushed like a boy. ‘It’s my
foolishness, I suppose, Margaret,’ he said with a
shy laugh. ‘I am certainly not clever.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Anyhow, you can be foolish or clever here to
your heart’s content. You must use the place as
though it were your own exactly.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Thank you, Margaret.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Only I don’t think I quite understand all those
things,’ she added vaguely after a pause. ‘Nixie
talks rather like that. She has all poor Dick’s ideas
and strange fancies. I really can’t keep up with
her at all.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul stiffened at the reference to the children;
he remembered his attitude. Already he had
been guilty of a serious lapse from his good
intentions.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘She comes down to this wood far too much,
and I’m sure it’s not quite healthy for her. I
always forget to speak to Mlle. Fleury.’ Then she
turned to him and smiled. ‘But they are all so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>excited about your coming. They will simply devour
you.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m a poor hand at children, I’m afraid,’ he
said, falling back upon his usual formula, ‘but, of
course, I shall be delighted to see them.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She gathered up her white skirts about her trim
ankles and led the way out of the wood, her brother
following and thinking how slim and graceful she
was, and what a charming figure she made among
the rose-trees. He got the impression of her as
something unreal and shadowy, a creature but half
alive. It would hardly have surprised him to see
her suddenly flit off into mist and sunshine and
disappear from view, leaving him with the certainty
that he had been talking with a phantasm of a dream.
Between himself and her, however, he realised now,
there was a gulf fixed. They looked at one another
as it were down the large end of a telescope, and
talked down a long-distance telephone that changed
all their words and made the sense unintelligible and
meaningless. The scale of values between them had
no common denominator. Yet he could love her,
and he meant to.</p>

<p class='c011'>They crossed the lawns and went through the
French window into the cool of the drawing-room,
and while he was sipping his first cup of afternoon
English tea, struggling with a dozen complex
emotions that stirred within him, there suddenly
darted across the lawn a vision of flying children,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>with a string of animals at their heels. They swept
out of some laurel shrubberies into the slanting
evening sunlight, and came to a dead stop on the
gravel path in front of the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their eyes met. They had seen him.</p>

<p class='c011'>There they stood, figures of suddenly arrested
motion, staring at him through the glass. ‘So
that’s Uncle Paul!’ was the thought in the mind
of each. He was being inspected, weighed, labelled.
The meeting with his sister was nothing compared
to this critical examination, conducted though it was
from a distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it lasted only a moment. With a sudden
quietness the children passed away from the window
towards another door round the corner, and so out
of sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They’ve gone up to get tidy before coming
to see you,’ explained his sister; and Paul used
the short respite to the best possible advantage by
collecting his thoughts, remembering his ‘attitude
and disguise,’ and seeing to it that his armour was
properly fastened on, leaving no loopholes for
sudden attack. He retired cautiously to the only
place in a room where a shy man feels really safe—the
mat before the fireplace. He almost wished for
his gun and hunting-knife. The idea made him
laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They already love you,’ he heard his sister’s
gentle whispering voice, ‘and I know you’ll love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>them too. You must never let them annoy you,
of course.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They’re your children—and Dick’s,’ he
answered quietly. ‘I shall get on with them
famously, I’m sure.’</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A few minutes later the door opened softly, and
a procession, solemn of face and silent of foot,
marched slowly into the room. The moment had
come at last for his introduction, and, by a single
stroke of unintentional diplomacy, his sister did
more to winning her brother’s shy heart than by
anything else she could possibly have devised. She
went out.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They will prefer to make your acquaintance
by themselves,’ she said in her gentle way, ‘and
without any assistance from me.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The procession advanced to the middle of the
room and then stopped short. Evidently, for them,
the departure of their mother somewhat complicated
matters. They had depended upon her to explain
them to their uncle. There they stood, overcome
by shyness, moving from one foot to another, with
flushed and rosy faces, hair brushed, skin shining, and
eyes all prepared to laugh as soon as somebody gave
the signal, but not the least knowing how to begin.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>And their uncle faced them in similar plight,
as, for the second time that afternoon, shyness
descended upon him like a cloud, and he could
think of nothing to say. His size overwhelmed
him; he felt like an elephant. With a sudden rush
all his self-possession deserted him. He almost
wished that his sister might return so that they
should be brought up to him <em>seriatim</em>, named just
as Adam named the beasts, and dismissed—which
Adam did not do—with a kiss. It was really, of
course—and he knew it to his secret mortification—a
meeting on both sides of children; they all felt
the shyness and self-consciousness of children, he
as much as they, and at any moment might take
the sudden plunge into careless intimacy, as the way
with children ever is.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, however, he took rapid and careful
note of them as they stood in that silent, fidgety
group before him, with solemn, wide-open eyes
fixed upon his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>The youngest, being in his view little more than
a baby, needs no description beyond the fact that
it stared quite unintelligently without winking an
eye. Its eyes, in fact, looked as though they were
not made to close at all. And this is its one and
only appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Standing next to the baby, holding its hand, was
a boy in a striped suit of knickerbockers, with a
big brown curl like a breaking wave on the top
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of his forehead; he was between eight and nine
years old, and his names—for, of course, he had
two—were Richard Jonathan, shortened, as Paul
learned later, into Jonah. He balanced himself with
the utmost care in the centre of a particular square
of carpet as though half an inch to either side
would send him tumbling into a bottomless abyss.
The fingers not claimed by the baby travelled
slowly to and fro along the sticky line of his lower
lip.</p>

<p class='c011'>Close behind him, treating similarly another
square of carpet, stood a rotund little girl, slightly
younger than himself, named Arabella Lucy. There
was a touch of audacity in her eyes, and an expression
about the mouth that indicated the
imminent approach of laughter. She had been
distinctly washed and brushed-up for the occasion.
Her face shone like a polished onion skin. She had
the same sort of brown hair that Jonah considered
fashionable, and her name for all common daily
purposes was Toby.</p>

<p class='c011'>The eldest and most formidable of his tormentors,
standing a little in advance of the rest, was Margaret
Christina, shortened by her father (who, indeed, had
been responsible for all the nicknames) into Nixie.
And the name fitted her like a skin, for she was the
true figure of a sprite, and looked as if she had just
stepped out of the water and her hair had stolen the
yellow of the sand. Her eyes ran about the room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>like sunshine from the surface of a stream, and her
movements instantly made Paul think of water
gliding over pebbles or ribbed sand with easy and
gentle undulations. Flashlike he saw her in a
clearing of his lonely woods, a creature of the
elements. Her big blue eyes, too, were full of
wonder and pensive intelligence, and she stood there
in a motherly and protective manner as though she
were quite equal to the occasion and would presently
know how to act with both courage and wisdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Nixie, indeed, it was, after this prolonged
and critical pause, who commenced operations.
There was a sudden movement in the group, and
the next minute Paul was aware that she had left it
and was walking slowly towards him. He noticed
her graceful, flowing way of moving, and saw a
sunburnt arm and hand extended in his direction.
The next second she kissed him. And that kiss
acted like an electric shock. Something in her that
was magical met its kind in his own soul and,
flamelike, leaped towards it. A little tide of hot
life poured into him, troubling the deeps with a
momentary sense of delicious bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘How do you do, Uncle Paul,’ she said; ‘we
are <em>very</em> glad you have come—at last.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The blood ran ridiculously to his head. He
found his tongue, and pulled himself sharply
together.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So am I, dear. Of course, it’s a long way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>come—America.’ He stooped and bestowed the
necessary kisses upon the others, who had followed
their leader and now stood close beside him, staring
like little owls in a row.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I know,’ she replied gravely. ‘It takes weeks,
doesn’t it? And mother has told us such a lot
about you. We’ve been waiting a very long time,
I think,’ she added as though stating a grievance.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I suppose it is rather a long time to wait,’ he
said sheepishly. He stroked his beard and waited.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘All of us,’ she went on. She included the others
in this last observation by bending her head at them,
and into her uncle’s memory leaped the vision of a
slender silver birch tree that grew on the edge of the
Big Beaver Pond near the Canadian border. She
moved just as that silver birch moved when the
breeze caught it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her manner was very demure, but she looked so
piercingly into the very middle of his eyes that Paul
felt as though she had already discovered everything
about him. They all stood quite close to him now,
touching his knees; ready, there and then, to take
him wholly into their confidence.</p>

<p class='c011'>An impulse that he only just managed to control
stirred in him and a curious pang accompanied it.
He remembered his ‘attitude,’ however, and stiffened
slightly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘No, it only takes ten days roughly from where
I’ve come,’ he said, leaving the mat and dropping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>into a deep arm-chair a little farther off. ‘The big
steamers go very fast, you know, nowadays.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Their eyes remained simply glued to his face.
They switched round a few points to follow his
movement, but did not leave their squares of carpet.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Madmerzelle said’—it was Toby, <i><span lang="fr">née</span></i> Arabella
Lucy, speaking for the first time—‘you knew lots
of stories about deers and wolves and things, and
would look like a Polar bear for us sometimes.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh yes, and beavers and Indians in snowstorms,
and the roarer boryalis,’ chimed in Jonah, giving a
little hop of excitement that brought him still closer.
‘And the songs they sing in canoes when there
are rapids,’ he added with intense excitement.
‘Madmizelle sings them sometimes, but they’re not
a bit the real thing, because she hasn’t enough bass
in her voice.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul bit his lip and looked at the carpet. Something
in the atmosphere of the room seemed to have
changed in the last few minutes. Jolly thrills ran
through him such as he knew in the woods with his
animals sometimes.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m afraid I can’t sing much,’ he said, ‘but I
can tell you a bear story sometimes—if you’re good.’
He added the condition as an afterthought.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We <em>are</em> good,’ Jonah said disappointedly, ‘almost
always.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Again that curious pang shot through him. He
did not wish to be unkind to them. He pulled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>back his coat-sleeve suddenly and showed them a
scar on his arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That was made by a bear,’ he said, ‘years ago.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, look at the fur!’ cried Toby.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Don’t be silly! All proper men have hair on
their arms,’ put in Jonah. ‘Does it still hurt, Uncle
Paul?’ he asked, examining the place with intense
interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not now. We rolled down a hill together head
over heels. Such a big brute, too, he was, and growled
like a thunderstorm; it’s a wonder he didn’t squash
me. I’ve got his claws upstairs. I think, really,
he was more frightened than I was.’</p>

<p class='c011'>They clapped their hands. ‘Tell us, oh, do
tell us!’</p>

<p class='c011'>But Nixie intervened in her stately fashion, leaning
over a little and stroking the scar with fingers
that were like the touch of leaves.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Uncle Paul’s tired after coming such a long
way,’ she said gravely with sympathy. ‘He hasn’t
even unpacked his luggage yet, have you, Uncle?’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul admitted that this was the case. He made
the least possible motion to push them off and clear
a space round his chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Are you tired? Oh, I’m <em>so</em> sorry,’ said Jonah.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then he ought to see the animals at once,’
decided Toby, ‘before they go to bed,’—she seemed
to have a vague idea that the whole world must go
to bed earlier than usual if Uncle Paul was tired—‘or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>they’ll be awfully disappointed.’ Her face
expressed the disappointment of the animals as well
as her own; her uncle’s fatigue had already taken
a second place. ‘Oughtn’t he?’ she added, turning
to the others.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul remembered his intention to remain stiffly
grown up.</p>

<p class='c011'>He made a great effort. Oh, but why did they
tug and tear at his heart so, these little fatherless
children? And why did he feel at once that he was
in their own world, comfortably ‘at home’ in it?
Did this world of children, then, link on so easily
and naturally with the poet’s region of imagination
and wonder in which he himself still dwelt for all
his many years, bringing him close to his main
passion—to know Reality?</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course, I’ll come and say good-night to them
before they turn in,’ he decided kindly, letting
Nixie and Toby take his hands, while Jonah followed
in the rear to show that he considered this a girl’s
affair yet did not wholly disapprove.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Hadn’t we better tell your mother where we’re
going?’ he asked as they started.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, mother won’t mind,’ came the answer in
chorus. ‘She hardly ever comes up to the nursery,
and, besides, she doesn’t care for the animals, you
see.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They’re rather ’noying for mother,’ Nixie added
by way of explanation. She decapitated many of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>long words in this way, and invariably omitted
difficult consonants.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a long journey, and the explanations about
the animals, their characteristics, names, and habits,
occupied every minute of the way. He gathered
that they were chiefly cats and kittens, to what
number he dared not calculate, and that puppies, at
least one parrot, a squirrel, a multitude of white
mice, and various larger beasts of a parental and
aged description, were indiscriminately all mixed up
together. Evidently it was a private menagerie that
he was invited to say good-night to, and the torrent
of outlandish names that poured into his ears produced
a feeling of confusion in his mind that made
him wonder if he was not turning into some sort
of animal himself, and thus becoming free of their
language.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the beginning of a very trying ordeal for
him, this being half pulled, half shoved along the
intricate passages of the old house; now down a
couple of unexpected steps that made him stumble;
now up another which made him trip; through
narrow doorways, where Jonah had the audacity to
push him from behind lest he should stick half-way;
and, finally, at full speed, the girls tugging at his
arms in front, down a long corridor which proved to
be the home-stretch to the nursery.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I was afraid we’d lost the trail,’ he gasped. ‘It’s
poorly blazed.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>‘Oh, but we haven’t got any tails to lose,’ laughed
Toby, misunderstanding him. ‘And they wouldn’t
blaze if we had.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Look out, Nixie! Not so fast! Uncle Paul’s
losing his wind as well as his trail,’ shouted Jonah
from the rear. And at that moment they reached
the door of the nursery and came to an abrupt halt,
Paul puffing like a lumberman.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was impossible for him to remain sedate, but
he did the next best thing—he remained silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Jonah, pushing past him, turned the handle,
and he was ushered, still panting, into so typical
a nursery-schoolroom that the scenes of his forgotten
boyhood rushed back to him with a vividness that
seemed to destroy the passage of time at a single
stroke. The past stood reconstructed. The actual,
living mood of his own childhood rose out of the
depths of blurred memories and caused a mist to rise
before his eyes. An emotion he was utterly unable
to define shook his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>The room was filled with the slanting rays of
the setting sun, and the air from the open windows
smelt of garden trees, lawns, and flower-beds. Sea
and heather, too, added their own sharper perfumes.
It caught him away for a moment—oh, that strange
power of old perfumes—to the earliest scenes of his
own life, the boyhood in the gardens of Kent before
America had claimed him. And then the details of
the room itself became so insistent that he almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>lost his head and turned back without more ado
into a boy of fifteen.</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked swiftly about him. There was the
old-fashioned upright piano against the wall, the
highly coloured pictures hanging crooked on the
wall, the cane chairs, the crowded mantelpiece, the
high wire fender before the empty grate, the general
atmosphere of toys, untidiness and broken articles
of every sort and kind—and, above all, the figures
of these excited children all bustling recklessly about
him with their glowing and expectant faces.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was Toby, her blue sash all awry, running
busily about the room; and Nixie, now in sunshine,
now in shadow, with her hair of yellow sand and
her blue dreaming eyes that saw into the Beyond;
and little Jonah, moving about somewhat pompously
to prepare the performance that was to follow. It
all combined to produce a sudden shock that swept
down upon him so savagely, that he was within an
ace of bolting through the door and making his
escape into safer quarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>The False Paul, that is, was within an ace of
running away with all his elaborate armour, and
leaving the True Paul dancing on the floor, a child
among children, a spirit of impulse, enthusiasm and
imagination, laughing with the sheer happiness of
his perpetual youth.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a dangerous moment; he was within
measurable distance of revealing himself. For a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>moment his clothes felt far too large for him; and
only just in time did he remember his ‘attitude,’
and the danger of being young when he really was
old, and the absurdity of being anything else than
a large, sedate man of forty-five. Only he wished
that Nixie would not watch him so appealingly with
those starry eyes of hers&#160;... and look so strangely
like the forms that haunted his own wild forests
and streams on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c011'>He stiffened quickly, drew himself up, and turned
to give his elderly attention to the chorus of explanation
and introduction that was already rising
about him with the sound and murmur of the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something was happening.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the floor of the room, he now perceived,
had become suddenly full of movement, as though
the carpet had turned alive. He felt a rubbing
against his legs and ankles; with a soft thud something
leaped upon the table and covered his hand
with smooth, warm fur, uttering little sounds of
pleasure at the same time. On the top of the piano,
a thing he had taken for a heap of toys rose and
stretched itself into an odd shape of straight lines
and arching curves. From the window-sill, where
the sun poured in, a round grey substance dropped
noiselessly down upon the carpet and advanced with
measured and calculated step towards him; while,
from holes and hiding-places undivined, three or
four little fluffy things, with padded feet and stiff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>pointing tails, shot out like shadows and headed
straight for a row of saucers that he now noticed for
the first time against the farther wall. The whole
room seemed to fill with soft and graceful movement;
and, mingled with the voices of the children,
he caught a fine composite murmur that was soothing
as the sound of flowing wind and water.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the sound and the movement of many
animals.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Here they are,’ said a voice—‘some of them.
The others are lost, or out hunting.’</p>

<p class='c011'>For the moment Paul did not stop to ask how
many ‘others’ there were. He stood rigidly still
for fear that if he moved he might tread on something
living.</p>

<p class='c011'>There came a scratching sound at the door, and
Toby dashed forward to open it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Silly, naughty babies!’ she cried, nearly tumbling
over the fender in her attempt to seize two
round bouncing things that came tearing into the
room like a couple of yellow puddings. ‘Uncle
Paul has come to see you all the way from America!
And then you’re late like this! For shame!’</p>

<p class='c011'>With a series of thuds and bangs that must have
bruised anything not unusually well padded, the
new arrivals, who looked for all the world like
small fat bears, or sable muffs on short brown legs
with feet of black velvet, dashed round the room
in a mad chase after nothing at all. A hissing and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>spitting issued from dark corners and from beneath
various pieces of furniture, but the two balls confined
their attentions almost at once to the honoured
guest. They charged up against his legs as though
determined to upset his balance—this mountain of
a man—and then careered clumsily round the room,
knocking over anything small enough that came
in their way, and behaving generally as though they
wanted to clear the whole place in the shortest
possible time for their own particular and immediate
benefit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next, lifting his eyes for a moment from this
impetuous attack, he saw a brilliantly coloured thing
behind bars, standing apparently on its head and
looking upside-down at him with an expression of
undisguised and scornful amusement; while not far
from it, in a cage hanging by the cuckoo clock,
some one with a tail as large as his body, shot
round and round on a swinging trapeze that made
Paul think of a midget practising in a miniature
gymnasium.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘These are our animals, you see, Uncle Paul,’
Jonah announced proudly from his position by the
door. There was a trace of condescension in his tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We have lots of out-of-door animals as well,
though,’ Toby hastened to explain, lest her uncle
should be disappointed.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I suppose they’re out of doors?’ said Paul
lamely.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>‘Of course they are,’ replied Jonah; ‘in the
stables and all about.’ He turned to Nixie, who
stood quietly by her uncle’s side in a protective way,
superintending. Nixie nodded corroboration.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Now, we’ll introduce you—gradgilly,’ announced
Toby, stooping down and lifting with immense
effort the large grey Persian that had been
sleeping on the window-sill when they came in.
She held it with great difficulty in her arms and
hands, but in spite of her best efforts only a portion
of it found actual support, the rest straggling away
like a loosely stuffed bolster she could not encompass.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was evidently accustomed to being dealt with
thus in sections, for it continued to purr sleepily,
blinking its large eyes with the usual cat-smile, and
letting its head fall backwards as though it suddenly
desired to examine the ceiling from an entirely fresh
point of view. None of its real attention, of course,
was given to the actual proceeding. It merely
suffered the absurd affair—absent-mindedly and
with condescension. Its whiskers moved gently.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What’s its name?’ he asked kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>Her</em> name,’ whispered Nixie.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We call her Mrs. Tompkyns, because it’s old
now,’ Toby explained, ignoring genders.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘After the head-gardener’s gra’mother,’ Nixie explained
hastily in his ear; ‘but we might change it
to Uncle Paul in honour of you now, mightn’t we?’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>‘Mrs. Uncle Paul,’ corrected Jonah, looking
on with slight disapproval, and anxious to get to
the white mice and the squirrel.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It would be a pity to change the name, I
think,’ Paul said, straightening himself up dizzily
from the introduction, and watching the splendid
creature fall upon its head from Toby’s weakening
grasp, and then march away with unperturbed
dignity to its former throne upon the window-sill.
‘I feel rather afraid of Mrs. Tompkyns,’ he added;
‘she’s so very majestic.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, you needn’t be,’ they cried in chorus.
‘It’s all put on, you know, that sort of grand
manner. <em>We</em> knew her when she was a kitten.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The object-lesson was not lost upon him. Of
all creatures in the world, he reflected as he watched
her, cats have the truest dignity. They absolutely
refuse to be laughed at. No cat would ever betray
its real self, yet here was he, a grown-up, intelligent
man, vacillating, and on the verge already of hopeless
capitulation.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And what’s the name of <em>these</em> persons?’ he
asked quickly, turning for safety to Nixie, who
had her arms full of a writhing heap she had been
diligently collecting from the corners of the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, that’s only Mrs. Tompkyns’ family,’
exclaimed Jonah impatiently; ‘the last family, I
mean. She’s had lots of others.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The last family before this was only two,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Nixie told him. ‘We called them Ping and
Pong. They live in the stables now. But these
we call Pouf, Sambo, Spritey, Zezette, and
Dumps——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And the next ones,’ Toby broke in excitedly,
‘we’re going to call with the names on the engines
when we go up to London to see the dentist.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Or the names of the Atlantic steamers wouldn’t
be bad,’ said Paul.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not bad,’ Jonah said, with lukewarm approval;
‘only the engines would be much better.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There may not be any next ones,’ opined Toby,
emerging from beneath a sofa after a frantic, but
vain, attempt to catch something alive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jonah snorted with contempt. ‘Of course there
will. They come in bunches all the time, just like
grapes and chestnuts and things. Madmizelle told
me so. There’s no end to them. Don’t they,
Uncle Paul?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I believe so,’ said the authority appealed to,
extracting his finger with difficulty from the teeth
and claws of several kittens.</p>

<p class='c011'>There came a lull in the proceedings, the majority
of the animals having escaped, and successfully
concealed themselves among what Toby called
‘the furchinur.’ Paul was still following a prior
train of reflection.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes, cats are really rather wonderful creatures,’
he mused aloud in spite of himself, turning instinctively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>in the direction of Nixie. ‘They possess a
mysterious and superior kind of intelligence.’</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment it was exactly as if he had tapped
his armour and said, ‘Look! It’s all sham!’</p>

<p class='c011'>The child peered sharply up in his face. There
was a sudden light in her eyes, and her lips were
parted. He had not exactly expected her to answer,
but somehow or other he was not surprised when
she did. And the answer she made was just the
kind of thing he knew she would say. He was
annoyed with himself for having said so much.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And they lead secret little lives somewhere else,
and only let us see what they want us to see. I
knew you understood <em>really</em>.’ She said it with an
elfin smile that was certainly borrowed from moonlight
on a mountain stream. With one fell swoop
it caught him away into a world where age simply
did not exist. His mind wavered deliciously. The
singing in his heart was almost loud enough to be
audible.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he just saved himself. With a sudden
movement he leaned forward and buried his face
in the pie of kittens that nestled in her arms,
letting them lose their paws for a moment in his
beard. The kittens might understand, but at
least they could not betray him by putting it
into words. It was a narrower escape than he
cared for.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And these are the Chow puppies,’ cried Jonah,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>breathless from a long chase after the sable muffs.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We call them China and Japan.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul welcomed the diversion. Their teeth were
not nearly so sharp as the kittens’, and they
burrowed with their black noses into his sleeves.
So thick was their fur that they seemed to have
no bones at all; their dark eyes literally dripped
laughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>With an effort he put on a more sedate manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You <em>have</em> got a lot of beasts,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Animals,’ Nixie corrected him. ‘Only toads,
rats, and hedgehogs are beasts. And, remember,
if you’re rude to an animal, as Mademoiselle Fleury
was once, it only ’spises you—and then——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I beg their pardon,’ he put in hurriedly; ‘I
quite understand, of course.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You see it’s rather important, as they want to
like you, and unless you respect them they can’t,
can they?’ she finished earnestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I do respect them, believe me, Nixie, and I
appreciate their affection. Affection and respect
must always go together.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The children were wholly delighted. Paul had
completely won their hearts from the very beginning.
The parrot, the squirrel, and the white mice were
all introduced in turn to him, and he heard sundry
mysterious allusions to ‘the owl in the stables,’
‘Juliet and her two kids,’ to say nothing of dogs,
ponies, pigeons, and peacocks, that apparently dwelt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>in the regions of outer space, and were to be reserved
for the morrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>The performance was coming to an end. Paul
was already congratulating himself upon having
passed safely, if not with full credit, through a
severe ordeal, when the door opened and a woman of
about twenty-five, with a pleasant face full of character
and intelligence, stood in the doorway. A torrent
of French instantly broke loose on all sides. The
woman started a little when she perceived that the
children were not alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, Mademoiselle, this is Uncle Paul,’ they
cried, each in a different fashion. ‘This is <em>our</em>
Uncle Paul! He’s just been introduced to the
animals, and now he must be introduced to
you.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul shook hands with her, and the introduction
passed off easily enough; the woman was charming,
he saw at the first glimpse, and possessed of tact.
She at once took his side and pretended to scold
her charges for having plagued and bothered him
so long. Evidently she was something more to
them than a mere governess. The lassitude of
his sister, no doubt, gave her rights and responsibilities.</p>

<p class='c011'>But what impressed Paul when he was alone—for
her simple remark that it was past bedtime was
followed by sudden kisses and disappearance—was
the remarkable change that her arrival had brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>about in the room. It came to him with a definite
little shock. It was more than significant, he felt.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was this: that the children, though
obviously they loved her, treated her as some one
grown up and to be obeyed, whereas himself, he now
realised, they had all along treated as one of themselves
to whom they could be quite open and natural.
His ‘attitude’ they had treated with respect, just as
he had treated the attitude of the animals with
respect, but at the same time he had been made
to feel one of themselves, in their world, part and
parcel of their own peculiar region. There had been
nothing forced about it whatever. Whether he
liked it or not they accepted him. His ‘attitude’
was not regarded seriously. It was not regarded at
all. And this was grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was so simple that he would never have
thought of this but for the entrance of the
governess. Her arrival threw it all into sharp
relief. Clearly the children recognised no barrier
between themselves and him; he had been taken
without parley straight into their holy of holies.
Nixie, as leader and judge, had carried him off
at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this was a very subtle and powerful
compliment that made him think a great deal.
He would either have to drop his armour altogether
or make it very much more effective.</p>

<p class='c011'>Indeed, it was the immediate problem in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>mind as he slowly made his way downstairs to
find his sister on the lawn, and satisfy her rather
vague curiosity by telling her that the children had
introduced him to the animals, and that he had
got on famously with them all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Paul went early to bed that night. It was his first
night in an English country home for many years;
strange forces were at work in him. His introduction
to the children, his meeting with Nixie especially,
had let loose powers in his soul that called for sober
reflection; and he felt the need of being alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another thing, too, urged him to seek the solitude
of his chamber, for after dinner he had sat for a
couple of hours with his sister, talking over the
events and changes of the long interval since they
had met,—the details that cannot be told in letters,
the feelings that no one writes. And he came upstairs
with his first impression of her character
slightly modified. She had more in her than he
first divined. Beneath that shadowy and silken
manner he had caught traces of distinct purpose.
For one thing she was determined to keep him in
England.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>He had told her frankly about his arrangement
with the lumber Company, explaining that he regarded
his present visit in the light of a holiday.
‘I suppose that is—er—wise of you,’ she said, but
she had not been able to conceal her disappointment.
She asked him presently if he really wanted to live
all his life in such a place, and what it was in English
life, or civilised, conventional life, that he so disliked,
and Paul, feeling distinctly uncomfortable—for he
loathed giving pain—had answered evasively, with
more skill than he knew, ‘“Where your treasure is,
there shall your heart be also.” I suppose my treasure—the
only kind I know—is out there in the great
woods, Margaret.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Paul, are you married, then?’ she asked with a
start; and when he laughed and assured her most
emphatically that he was not, she looked exceedingly
puzzled and a little shocked too. ‘Are you so very
fond of this—er—treasure, then?’ she asked point
blank in her softest manner, ‘and is she so—I mean,
can’t you bring her home and acknowledge her?’
And after his first surprise when he had gathered her
meaning, it took him a long time to explain that
there was no woman concerned at all, and that it
was entirely a matter of his temperament.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Everybody makes his own world, remember,’ he
laughed, ‘and its size depends, I suppose, upon the
power of the imagination.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then I fear one’s imagination is a very poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>one,’ she said solemnly, ‘or else I have none at all.
I cannot pretend to understand your tastes for trees
and woods and things; but you’re exactly like poor
Dick in that way, and I suppose one must be really
clever to be like that.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘A year is a long time, Margaret,’ he said after
a pause, to comfort her. ‘Much may happen before
it’s over.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I hope so,’ she had answered, standing behind
his chair and stroking his head. ‘By that time you
may have met some one who will reconcile you to—to
staying here—a little longer.’ She patted his
head as though he were a Newfoundland dog, he
thought. It made him laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Perhaps,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, now in his room, before the candles were
lighted, he was standing by the open window, thinking
it all over. Of women, of course, he knew little
or nothing; to him they were all charming, some
of them wonderful; and he was not conscious that
his point of view might be considered by a man of
the world—of the world that is little, sordid, matter-of-fact—distinctly
humorous. At forty-five he believed
in women just as he had believed in them at
twenty, only more so, for nothing had ever entered
his experience to trouble an exquisite picture in his
mind. They stood nearer to God than men did, he
felt, and the depravity of really bad women he explained
by the fact that when they did fall they fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>farther. The sex-fever, so far as he was concerned,
had never mounted to his brain to obscure his vision.</p>

<p class='c011'>He only knew—and knew it with a sacred wonder
that was akin to worship—that women, like the
angels, were beyond his reach and beyond his understanding.
Comely they all were to him. He looked
up to them in his thoughts, not for their reason or
strength, but for the subtlety of their intuition, their
power of sacrifice, and last but not least, for the
beauty and grace of their mere presence in a world
that was so often ugly and unclean.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The flame—the lamp—the glory—whatever it
may be called—keeps alight in their faces,’ he loved
to say to himself, ‘almost to the end. With men it
is gone at thirty—often at twenty.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And his sister, for all her light hold on life, and
the strain in her that in his simplicity he regarded as
rather ‘worldly,’ was no exception to the rule. He
thought her entirely good and wonderful, and, perhaps,
so far as she went, he was not too egregiously
mistaken. He looked for the best in everybody,
and so, of course, found it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Only she will never make much of me, or I of
her, I’m afraid,’ he thought as he leaned out of the
window, watching the scented darkness. ‘We shall
get along best by leaving each other alone and being
affectionate, so to speak, from a distance.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And, indeed, so far he had escaped the manifold
seductions by which Nature seeks to attain her great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>object of perpetuating the race. As a potential father
of many sons he was of course an object of legitimate
prey; but his forest life had obviated all that; his
whole forces had turned inwards for the creation
of the poet’s visions, and Nature in this respect, he
believed, had passed him by. So far as he was aware
there was no desire in him to come forth and perform
a belated duty to the world by increasing its
population. It was the first time any one had even
suggested to him that he should consider such a
matter, and the mere idea made him smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gradually, however, these thoughts cleared away,
and he turned to other things he deemed more
important.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night was still as imaginable; odours of earth
and woods were wafted into the room with the scent
of roses. Overhead, as he leaned on his elbow and
gazed, the stars shone thickly, like points of gold
pricked in a velvet curtain. A lost wind stirred
the branches; he could distinguish their solemn
dance against the constellations. Orion, slanting
and immense, tilted across the sky, the two stars at
the base resting upon the shoulder of the hill, and
far off, in the deeps of the night, the murmur of the
pines sounded like the breaking of invisible surf.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something indescribably fresh and wild in the taste
of the air carried him back again across the ocean.
The ancient woods he knew so well rose before the
horizon’s rim, swimming with purple shadows and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>alive with a continuous great murmur that stretched
for a hundred leagues. The picture of those desolate
places, lying in lonely grandeur beneath the glitter of
the Northern Lights, with a thousand lakes echoing
the laughter of the loons, came seductively before
his inner eye. The thought of it all stirred emotions
profound and primitive, emotions too closely married
to instincts, perhaps, to be analysed; something in
him that was ancestral, possibly pre-natal. There
was nothing in this little England that could move
him so in the same fashion. His thoughts carried
him far, far away....</p>

<p class='c011'>The faint sound of a church clock striking the
hour—a sound utterly alien to the trend of his
thoughts—brought him back again to the present.
He heard it across many fields, fields that had been
tilled for centuries, and there could have been no
more vivid or eloquent reminder that he was no
longer in a land where hedges, church bells, notice-boards,
and so forth were not. He came back with
a start, and a sensation almost akin to pain. He
felt cramped, caught, caged. The tinkling church
bells annoyed him.</p>

<p class='c011'>His thoughts turned, with a sudden jerk, as it
were, to the undeniable fact that he had been trying
to go about in a disguise, with a clumsy mask over
his face, so that he might appear decently grown up
in his new surroundings.</p>

<p class='c011'>A pair of owls began to hoot softly in the woods,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>answering one another like voices in a dream, and
just then the lost wind left the pine branches and
died away into the sky with a swift rush as of many
small wings. In the sudden pool of silence that
followed, he fancied he could hear across the dark
miles of heathland the continuous low murmur of
the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>The beauty of night, as ever, entered his soul,
but with a joy that was too solemn, too moving,
to be felt as pleasure. It touched something in him
beyond the tears of either pain or delight: something
that held in it a mysterious wonder so searching,
so poignant, as to be almost terrible.</p>

<p class='c011'>He caught his breath and waited.... The great
woods of the world, mountains, the sea, stars, and
the crying winds were always for him symbols of
the gateways into a mightier and ideal region, a
Beyond-world where he found rest for his yearnings
and a strange peace. They were his means of losing
himself in a temporary heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'>And to-night it was the beauty of an English
scene that carried him away; and this in spite of
his having summoned the wilder vision from across
the seas. Already the forces of his own country
were insensibly at work upon an impressionable
mind and temperament. The very air, so sweetly
scented as he drew it in between his lips, was charged
with the subtly-working influences of the ‘Old
Country.’ A new web, soft but mighty, was being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>woven about his spirit. Even now his heart was
conscious of its gossamer touch, as his dreams yielded
imperceptibly to a new colour.</p>

<p class='c011'>He followed vaguely, curiously, the leadings of
delicate emotions that had been stirred in him by
the events of the day. Symbols, fast-shifting,
protean, passed in suggestive procession before his
mind’s eye, in the way that symbols ever will—in
a poet’s heart. He thought of children, of <em>the</em>
children, and of the extraordinarily fresh appeal they
had made to him. Children: how near they, too,
stood to the great things of life, and all the nearer,
perhaps, for not being aware of it. How their farseeing
eyes and their simple, unlined souls pointed
the way, like Nature, to the ideal region of which
he was always dreaming: to Reality, to God.</p>

<p class='c011'>All real children knew and understood; were
ready to offer their timid yet unhesitating guidance,
and without question or explanation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had, then, Nixie and her troupe already taken
him prisoner? And were the soft chains already
twined about his neck?...</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul hardly acknowledged the question definitely
to himself. He was merely dreaming, and his
dreams, rising and falling like the tides of a sea,
bore him to and fro among the shoals and inlands
of the day’s events. The spell of the English
June night was very strong upon him, no doubt,
for presently a door opened somewhere behind him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and the very children he was thinking about danced
softly into the room. Nixie came up close and
gazed into his very eyes, and again there began that
odd singing in his heart that he had twice noticed
during the day. An atmosphere of magic, shot
with gold and silver, came with the child into the
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the fact was—though he realised it only
dimly—the Fates were now making him a deliberate
offer. Had he not been so absorbed, he would have
perceived and appreciated the delicacy of their action.
As a rule they command, whereas now they were
only suggesting.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was really his own heart asking. Here, in this
rambling country house under the hills, was an
opportunity of entering the region to which all that
was best and truest in him naturally belonged. The
experience might prove a stepping-stone to a final
readjustment of his peculiar being with the normal
busy world of common things. Here was a safety-valve,
as he called it, a channel through which he
might express much, if not all, of his accumulated
stores. The guides, now fast asleep in their beds,
had sent out their little dream-bodies to bring the
invitation; they were ready and waiting.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he, thinking there under the stars his queer,
long thoughts, bred in years of solitude, dallied
with the invitation, and—hesitated. The inevitable
pain frightened him—the pain of being young when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the world cries that you are old; the pang of the
eternal contrast when the world would laugh at what
seemed to it a foolish fantasy of youth—a pose, a
dream that must bring a bitter awakening! He
heard the voices but too plainly, and shrank quickly
from the sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Nixie, standing there beside him with such
gentle persistence, certainly made him waver.... The
temptation to yield was strong and seductive.... Yet,
when the faint splendour of the summer
moonrise dimmed the stars near the horizon, and
the pines shone tipped with silver, he found himself
borne down by the sense of caution that urged no
revolutionary change, and advised him to keep his
armour tightly buckled on in the disguise he had
adopted.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would wait and see—a little longer, at any
rate; and meanwhile he must be firm and stern
and dull; master of himself, and apparently normal.</p>

<p class='c011'>He walked to the dressing-table and lit his
candles, and, as he did so, caught a picture of himself
in the glass. There was a gleam of subdued
fire in his eyes, he thought, that was not naturally
there. Something about him looked a little wild;
it made him laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed to think how utterly absurd it was
that a man of his size and age, and—But the idea
refused to frame himself in language—He did not
know exactly why he laughed, for at the same time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>he felt sad. With him, as with all other children,
tears and laughter are never far apart. It would
have been just as intelligible if he had cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when the candles were out and he was in
bed, and the stars were peeping into the darkened
room, the memory of his laughter seemed unreal,
and the sound of it oddly remote.</p>

<p class='c011'>For, after all, that laughter was rather mysterious.
It was not the Outer Paul laughing at
the Inner Paul. It was the Inner Paul laughing
with himself.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The psychology of sleep being apparently beyond
all intelligible explanation, it was not surprising that
he woke up next morning as though he had gone
to bed without a single perplexity. He remembered
none of the thoughts that had thronged his brain a
few short hours before; perhaps they had all slipped
down into the region of submerged consciousness, to
crop out later in natural, and apparently spontaneous,
action.</p>

<p class='c011'>At any rate he remembered little enough of his
troubles when he woke and saw the fair English sun
streaming in through the open windows. Odours of
woods and dew-drenched lawns came into the room,
and the birds were singing with noise enough to
waken all the country-side. It was impossible to lie
in bed. He was up and dressed long before any
servant came to call him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Downstairs he found the house in darkness; doors
barred and windows heavily shuttered as though the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>house had expected an attack. Not a soul was
stirring. The air was close and musty. The idea
of having to strike a match in a ‘country’ house at
6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> somehow oppressed him. Not knowing his
way about very well yet, he stumbled across the hall
to find a door, and as he did so something soft came
rubbing against his legs. He put his hand down in
the darkness and felt a furry, warm body and a stiff
upright tail that reached almost to his knees. The
thing began to purr.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I declare!’ he exclaimed; ‘Mrs. Tompkyns!’
and he struck a match and followed her to the
drawing-room door. A moment later they had
unfastened the shutters of the French window—Mrs.
Tompkyns assisting by standing on her hind
legs and tapping the swinging bell—and made their
way out on to the lawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sunshine came slanting between the cedars
and lay in shining strips on the grass. Everything
glistened with dew. The air was sweet and fresh
as it only is in the early hours after the dawn. Very
faintly, as though its mind was not yet made up, the
air stirred among the bushes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul’s first impulse was to waken the entire
household so that they might share with him this
first glory of the morning. ‘Probably they don’t
know how splendid it is!’ The thought of the
sleeping family, many of them perhaps with closed
windows, missing all the wonder, was a positive pain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>to him. But, fortunately for himself, he decided
it might be better not to begin his visit in this
way.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I guess you and I, Mrs. Tompkyns, are the
only people about,’ he said, looking down at the
beautiful grey creature that sniffed the air calmly
at his feet. ‘Come on, then. Let’s make a raid
together on the woods!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He threw a disdainful glance at the sleeping
house; no smoke came from the chimneys; most
of the upper windows were closed. A delicious
fragrance stole out of the woods to meet him as he
strolled across the wet lawn. He felt like a schoolboy
doing something out of bounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You lead and I follow,’ he said, addressing his
companion in mischief.</p>

<p class='c011'>And at once his attention became absorbed in the
animal’s characteristic behaviour. Obviously it was
delighted to be with him; yet it did not wish him
to think so, or, if he did think so, to give any sign
of the fact. Nothing could have been plainer.
First it crept along by the stone wall delicately, with
its body very close to the ground as though the
weight of the atmosphere oppressed it; and when
he spoke, it turned its head with an affectation of
genuine surprise as though it would say, ‘You here!
I thought I was alone.’ Then it sat down on the
gravel path and began to wash its face and paws
till he had passed, after which—when he was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>looking, of course—it followed him condescendingly,
sniffing at blades of grass <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> without actually
touching them, and flicking its tail upwards with
sudden, electric jerks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul understood in a general way what was
expected of him. He watched it surreptitiously,
pretending to examine the flowers. For this, he
knew, was the great Cat Game of elaborate pretence.
And Mrs. Tompkyns, true adept in the art, played
up wonderfully, and incidentally taught him much
about the ways and methods of simple disguise;
it advanced stealthily when he wasn’t looking; it
stopped to wash, or gaze into the air, the moment
he turned. It was very shy, and very affected, and
very self-conscious. Inimitable was the way it kept
to all the little rules of the game. It walked daintily
down the path after him, shaking the dew from
its paws with a rapid, quivering motion. Then,
suddenly arching its back as though momentarily
offended—at nothing—it stared up at him with an
expression that seemed to question his very existence.
‘I guess I ought to fade away when you look at me
like that!’ was his thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m here. I’m coming, Mrs. Tompkyns,’ he
felt constrained to remark aloud before going
forward again. ‘The grand morning excites my
blood just as much as it excites your own.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed necessary to assert his presence. No
intelligent person can be conceited long in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>presence of a cat. No living creature can so
sublimely ‘ignore.’ But Paul was not conceited.
He continued to watch it with delight.</p>

<p class='c011'>One very important rule of the game appeared
to be that plenty of bushes were necessary by way
of cover, so that it could pretend it was not really
coming farther than the particular bush where it was
hiding at the moment. Instinctively, he never made
the grave mistake of calling it to follow; and though
it never trotted alongside, being always either behind
or in front of him, the presence of the cat in his
immediate neighbourhood provided all sorts of company
imaginable. It had also provided him with
an opportunity to play the hero.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, suddenly, the calm and peace of the
morning was disturbed by a scene of strange
violence. Mrs. Tompkyns, with spread legs, dashed
past him at a surprising speed and flew up the trunk
of a big tree as though all the dogs in the county
were at her heels. From this position of vantage
she looked back over her shoulder with hysterical
and frightened eyes. There was a great show of
terror, a vast noise of claws upon the bark. No
actress could have created better the atmosphere of
immediate danger and alarm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul had an instinctive <em>flair</em> for this move of the
game. He made a great pretence of running up to
save the cat from its awful position, but of course
long before he got there she had dropped laughingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>to earth again, having thus impressed upon him the
value of her life.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘A question of life or death that time, I think,
Mrs. Tompkyns,’ he said soothingly, trying to stroke
her back. ‘I wonder if the head-gardener’s grandmother
after whom you were named ever did this
sort of thing. I doubt it!’</p>

<p class='c011'>But the creature escaped from him easily. For
no one is ever caught in the true Cat Game. It
scuttled down the path at full speed in a sort of
canter, but sideways, as though a violent wind blew
it and desperate resistance was necessary to keep on
its feet at all. After that its self-consciousness seemed
to disappear a little. It behaved normally. It stalked
birds that showed, however, no fear of its approach.
It sniffed the tips of leaves. It played baby-fashion
with various invisible companions; and finally it
vanished in a thick jungle of laurels to hunt in
savage earnest, and left Paul to his own devices.
Like all its kind, it only wished to prove how
charming it could be, in order to emphasise later
its utter independence of human sympathy and
companionship.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘If you <em>must</em> go, I suppose you must,’ he laughed,
‘and I shall try to enjoy myself without you.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He strolled on alone and lost himself in the pine-wood
that flanked the back lawn, stopping finally by
a gate that led to the world of gorse and heather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>beyond. The brilliant patches of yellow wafted
perfumes to his nostrils. Far in the distance a blue
line hinted where the sea lay; and over all lay the
radiance of the early morning. The old spell was
there that never failed to make his heart leap. And,
as he stood still, the cuckoo flitted, invisible and
mischievous, from tree to tree, calling with its flutelike
notes,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sung beyond memory,</div>
      <div class='line'>When golden to the winds this world of ours</div>
      <div class='line'>Waved wild with boundless flowers;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sung in some past where wildernesses were,—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>and his thoughts went roaming back to the great
woods he had left behind, woods where the naked
streams ran shouting and lawless, where the trees
had not learned self-consciousness, and where no
little tame folk trotted on velvet feet through trim
and scented gardens.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the virgin glory of the morning entered into
him with that searching sweetness which is almost
suffering, just as a few hours before the Night had
bewitched him with the mystery of her haunted
caverns. For the beauty of Nature that comes to
most softly, with hints, came to him with an exquisite
fierce fever that was pain,—with something
of the full-fledged glory that burst upon Shelley—and
to bear it, unrelieved by expression, was a
perpetual torment to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, after long musing that led he scarcely knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>where, Paul came back to himself—and laughed.
Laughter was better than sighing, and he was too
much of a child to go long without the sense of
happiness coming uppermost. He lit his pipe—that
most delicious of all, the pipe before breakfast—and
wandered out into the sea of yellow gorse, thinking
aloud, laughing, talking to himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something in the performance of Mrs. Tompkyns
awakened the train of thought of the night before.
The sublime acting of the animal—he dared not call
it ‘beast’—linked him on to the children’s world.
They, too, had a magnificent condescension for the
mere grown-up person. But he—he was <em>not</em> grown
up. It made him sigh and laugh to think of it.
He was a great, overgrown child, playing with
gorgeously coloured dreams while the world of
ordinary life passed him by.</p>

<p class='c011'>The animals and the children linked on again, of
course, with the region of fantasy and make-believe,
the world of creation, the world of eternity, the world
where thoughts were alive, and strong belief was a
creative act.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s where I still belong,’ he said aloud, picking
his way among the waves of yellow sea, ‘and I
shall never get out till I die, my visions unexpressed,
my singing dumb.’ He laughed and threw a stone
at a bush that had no blossoms. ‘Oh, if only I
knew how to link on with the normal world of fact
<em>without losing the other</em>!  To turn all these seething
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>dreams within me to some account. To show them
to others!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He ran and cleared a low gorse-bush with a
flying jump.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That would be worth living for,’ he continued,
panting; ‘to make these things real to all the
people who live in little cages. By Jove, it would
open doors and windows in thousands of cages all
over the world, besides providing me with the
outlet I must find some day or—’ he sprang over
a ditch, slipped, and landed head first into prickles—‘or
explode!’ he concluded with a shout of
laughter that no one heard but the cuckoos and
the yellow-hammers. Then he fell into a reverie,
and his thoughts travelled farther still—into the
Beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>Quickly recovering himself, and picking up his
pipe, he went on towards the house; and, as he
emerged from the pine copse again, the sound of a
gong, ringing faintly in the distance, brought him
back to earth with a shock almost as abrupt as the
ditch. Mrs. Tompkyns appeared simultaneously,
wearing an aspect of pristine innocence, admirably
assumed the instant she caught sight of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Fancy your being out here!’ was the expression
of her whole person, ‘and coming, too, in just
as the gong sounds!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Breakfast, I suppose!’ he observed. And she
trotted behind him like a dog. For all her affectations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>of superiority she wanted her milk just as much
as he wanted his coffee.</p>

<p class='c011'>He walked into the dining-room, through the
window, stiffening as he did so with the resolution
of the night before. His armour fitted him tightly.
Little animals, children, the too searching calls of
Nature, occult, symbolic, magical—all these must be
sternly resisted and suppressed in the company of
others. The danger of letting his imagination loose
was too alarming. The ridicule would overwhelm
him. In the eyes of the world he now lived in he
would seem simply mad. The risk was impossible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like the Christian Scientists, he felt the need
of vigorous affirmation: ‘I am Paul Rivers. I am
a grown-up man. I am an official in a lumber
Company. I am forty-five. I have a beard. I am
important and sedate.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus he fortified himself; and thus, like the
persuasive Mrs. Tompkyns on the lawn, he imagined
that he was deceiving both himself—and those who
were <em>on the watch</em>!</p>

<p class='c010'>A week passed quickly away and found Paul still
in his sister’s house. The country air agreed with
him, and he went for long walks over the heathery
hills and down to the sea. The little private study
provided for him,—remembering Mrs. Tompkyns’
example, he made a brave pretence of having reports
to write to his lumber Company—was admirable
for his work. As a place of retreat when he felt
temptation too strong upon him, or danger was near
at hand, he used it constantly. He scented conditions
in advance very often, though no one probably would
have suspected it of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once or twice he lunched out with neighbours,
and sometimes people motored over to tea; companionship
and society were at hand if he wanted
them. And books of the kind he loved stood in
precious rows upon the shelves of Dick’s well-stored
library. Here he browsed voraciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>His sister, meanwhile, showed tact hardly to be
expected of her. She tried him tentatively with
many things to see if he liked them, but she made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>no conspicuous plans for him, and took good care
that he was left entirely to his own devices. A kind
of intelligent truce had established itself between
them—these two persons who lived in different
worlds and stared at one another with something
like astonishment over the top of a high wall.
Moreover, her languid interest in life made no claims
upon him; there was pleasant companionship, gentle
talks, and genuine, if thinly coloured, affection. He
felt absolutely free, yet was conscious of being looked
after with kindness and discretion. She managed
him so well, in fact, that he hardly realised he was
being managed at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>He fell more easily than he had thought possible
into the routine of the uneventful country life.
From feeling ‘caged’ he came to feel  ‘comfortable.’
June, and the soft forces of the summer, purred
about him, and almost without knowing it he began
to purr with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>For his superabundant energy he found relief
in huge walks, early and late, and in all manner
of unnecessary and invented labours of Hercules
about the place. Thus, he dammed up the little
stream that trickled harmlessly through the Gwyle
pine-wood, making a series of deep pools in which
he bathed when the spirit moved him; he erected
a gigantic and very dangerous see-saw for the
children (and himself) across a fallen trunk; and,
by means of canvas, boards, and steps, he constructed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>a series of rooms and staircases in a spreading ilex tree,
with rope railings and bells at each ‘floor’ for
visitors, so that even the gardeners admitted it was
the most wonderful thing they had ever set eyes
upon in a tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the children he was, however, careful to play
the part he had decided to play. He was kind and
good-natured; he spent a good deal of time with
them daily; he even submitted periodically to be
introduced all over again to the out-of-door animals,
but he went through it all soberly and deliberately,
and flattered himself that he was quite successful
in presenting to them the ‘Uncle Paul’ whom
it was best for his safety they should know.</p>

<p class='c011'>Heart-searchings and temptations he had in
plenty, but came through the ordeal with flying
colours, and by the end of the first week he was
satisfied that they accepted him as he wished—sedate,
stolid, dull, and ‘grown up.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, all the time, there was something that
puzzled him. Under the leadership of Nixie the
children played up almost too admirably. It was
almost as though he had called them and explained
everything in detail. In spite of himself, they
seemed somehow or other to have got into his
confidence, so that he felt his pretence was after
all not so effective as he meant it to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even—nay, especially—the way he was ‘accepted’
by the animals was suspicious—for nothing can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>be more eloquent of the true relations between
children and a grown-up than the terms they permit
their animals to have towards him—and this easy
acceptance of himself as he pretended to be constituted
the most wearing and subtle kind of attack
he could possibly conceive. He felt as if the steel
casings of his armour were changing into cardboard;
soon they would become mere tissue-paper, and then
turn transparent and melt away altogether.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They seem to think it’s all put on, this stiffness of
mine,’ he thought more than once. ‘Perhaps they’re
playing a sort of game with me. If once they find
out I’m only acting—whew!’ he whistled low—‘the
game is up at once! I must keep an eye peeled!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Consequently he kept that eye peeled; he made
more use of his private study, and so often gave
the excuse of having reports to write that, had it
been true, his lumber Company would have been
obliged to double its staff in order to read them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, even in the study, he was not absolutely safe.</p>

<p class='c011'>The children penetrated there too. They knocked
elaborately—always; but with the knock he invariably
realised a roguish pair of eyes and a sly laugh
on the other side of the door. It was like knocking
on his heart direct. He always said—in a bored,
unnatural tone:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, come in, whoever it is!’ knowing quite
well who it was. And, then, in they would come—one
or the other of them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>They slipped in softly as shadows, like the coming
of dusk, like stray puffs of wind, fragrant and
summery, or like unexpected rays of light as the
sun walked round the house in the afternoon. And
when they were gone—swiftly, like the sun dipping
behind a cloud—lo, the room seemed cold and
empty again.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, they’re up to something, they’re up to
something,’ he said wisely to himself with a sigh.
‘They’re laying traps for me, bless their little
insolences!’</p>

<p class='c011'>And the more he thought about it, the more
certain he felt that Nixie, Jonah, and Toby were
simply playing the Cat Game—pretending to accept
his attitude because they saw he wished it. Only,
less occult and intelligent than the cat, they sometimes
made odd little slips that betrayed them.</p>

<p class='c011'>For instance, one evening Jonah penetrated into
the study to say good-night, and brought the Chow
puppies, China and Japan, with him. Their tails
curled over their backs like wire brushes; their
vigorous round bodies, for ever on the move,
were all he could manage. Having been duly
kissed, the child waited, however, for something
else, and at length, receiving no assistance from
his uncle, he lifted each puppy in turn on to
the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You, Uncle, please hold them; I can’t,’ he
explained.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>And, rather grimly, Paul tried to keep the two
wriggling bodies still, while Jonah then came up
a little closer to his chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>They</em> have reports to write too, to their lumber-kings,’
he said, his face solemn as a gong—using
a phrase culled heaven knows where. ‘So will
you please see that they don’t make blots either.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But how did you know there were such things as
lumber-kings?’ Paul asked, surprised.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I didn’t know. They knew,’ with a jerk of his
head toward the struggling puppies, who hated the
elevation of the table and the proximity of Paul’s
bearded face. ‘They said you told them.’</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no trace of a smile in his eyes;
nothing but the earnest expression of the child
taking part in the ponderous make-believe of the
grown-up. Paul felt that by this simple expedient
his reports and the safety they represented had
been reduced in a single moment to the level of a
paltry pretence.</p>

<p class='c011'>He blushed. ‘Well, tell them to run after their
tails more, and think less,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘All right, Uncle Paul,’ and the boy was gone,
grave as any judge.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Toby, her small round face still shining
like an onion skin, had a different but equally
effective method of showing him that he belonged
to their world in spite of his clumsy pretence. She
gave him lessons in Natural History. One afternoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>when a brightly-coloured creature darted across
the page of his book, and he referred to it as a
‘beetle,’ she very smartly rebuked him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not beetle, but beetie, <em>that</em> one,’ she corrected
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He thought at first this was merely a child’s
abbreviation, but she went on to instruct him fully,
and he discovered that the ordinary coleopterist has
a great deal yet to learn in the proper classification
of his species.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There are beetles, and beedles, and beeties,’ she
explained standing by his chair on the lawn, and
twiddling with his watch-chain. ‘Beeties are all
bright-coloured and little and very pretty—like
ladybirds.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And beedles?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, b-e-e-e-d-d-dles,’ pronouncing the word
heavily and slowly, ‘are the stupid fat ones in the
road that always get run over. They’re always
sleepy, you see, but quite nice, oh, quite nice;’ she
hastened to add lest Paul should dislike them from
her description.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And all the rest are beetles, I suppose, just
ordinary beetles?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Beetles,’ she said, with the calmness of superior
knowledge, ‘are fast, black things that scuttle about
kitchens. Horrid and crawly! <em>Now</em> you know
them all!’</p>

<p class='c011'>She ran off with a burst of laughter upon that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>face of polished onion skin, and left her uncle to
reflect deeply upon this new world of beetles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lesson was instructive and symbolic, though
the choice of subject was not as poetic as might have
been. With this new classification as a starting-point,
the child, no doubt, had erected a vast superstructure
of wonder, fun, beauty, and—why not?—truth!
For children, he mused, are ever the true
idealists. In their games of make-believe they
create the world anew—in six minutes. They
scorn measurements, and deal directly with the
eternal principles behind things. With a little mud
on the end of a stick they trace the course of the
angels, and with the wooden-blocks of their building-boxes
they erect the towering palaces of a universe
that shall never pass away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet what they did, surely he also did! His
world of imagination was identical with theirs of
make-believe. Was, then, the difference between
them one of expression merely?...</p>

<p class='c011'>Toby came thundering up and fell upon him
from nowhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Uncle Paul,’ she said rather breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes, dear,’ he made answer, still thinking upon
beedles and beeties.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘On the path down there by the rosydandrums
there’s a beedle now—a big one with horns—if
you’d like to see it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh! By the rhododendrons, you mean?’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>‘Yes, by the rosydandrums,’ she repeated.
‘Only we must be quick or he’ll get home before
we come.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He was far more keen to see that “beedle” than
she was. Yet for the immediate safety of his soul
he refused.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie it was, however, who penetrated furthest
into the fortress. She came with a fearless audacity
that fairly made him tremble. She had only to
approach for him to become aware how poorly his
suit of armour fitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she was so gentle and polite about it that
she was harder to withstand than all the others put
together. She was slim and insinuating in body,
mind and soul. Often, before he realised what she
was talking about, her slender little fingers were
between the cracks of his breast-plate. For instance,
after leaving Toby and her “beedle,” he
strolled down to the pine-wood and stood upon
the rustic bridge watching the play of sunlight and
shadow, when suddenly, out of the very water it
seemed, up rose a veritable water-sprite—hatless
and stockingless—Nixie, the ubiquitous.</p>

<p class='c011'>She scrambled lightly along the steep bank to
his side, and leaned over the railing with him,
staring at their reflections in the stream.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I declare you startled me, child!’ Paul exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her eyes met his in the running reflection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>beneath them. Of course, it may have been merely
the trick of the glancing water, but to him it seemed
that her expression was elfin and mischievous.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Did I—<em>really</em>, Uncle Paul?’ she said after a
long silence, and without looking up. But woven
through the simple words, as sunlight is woven
through clearing mist, he divined all the other
meanings of the child’s subtle and curious
personality. It amounted to this—she at once invited,
nay included, him in her own particular tree
and water world: included him because he belonged
there with her, and she simply couldn’t help herself.
There was no favour about it one way or the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>The compliment—the temptation—was overwhelming.
Paul shivered a little, actually shivered,
as he stood beside her in the sunshine. For several
minutes they leaned there in silence, gazing at the
flowing water.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The woods are <em>very</em> busy—this evening,’ she
said at length.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m sure they are,’ he answered, before he quite
realised what he was saying. Then he pulled himself
together with an effort.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But does Mlle. Fleury know, and approve—?’
he asked a little stiffly, glancing down at her bare
legs and splashed white frock.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, no,’ she laughed wickedly, ‘but then
Mlle. only understands what she sees with her eyes!
She is much too mixed up and educated to know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>all <em>this</em> kind of thing!’  She made a gesture to
include the woods about them. ‘Her sort of
knowledge is so stuffing, you know.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Rather,’ he exclaimed. ‘I would far sooner
know the trees themselves than know their Latin
names.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It slipped out in spite of himself. The next
minute he could have bitten his tongue off. But
Nixie took no advantage of him. She let his words
pass as something taken for granted.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I mean—it’s better to learn useful things while
you can,’ he said hurriedly, blushing in his confusion
like a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie peered steadily down into the water for
several minutes before she said anything more.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Either she’s found me out and knows everything,’
thought Paul; ‘or she hasn’t found me
out and knows nothing.’ But which it was, for
the life of him, he couldn’t be certain.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh,’ she cried suddenly, looking up into his
face, her eyes, to Paul’s utter amazement, wet
with tears, ‘Oh! how Daddy must have loved
you!’</p>

<p class='c011'>And, before he could think of a word to say,
she was gone! Gone into the woods with a fluttering
as of white wings.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So apparently I am not too mixed up and
educated for their exquisite little world,’ he reflected,
as soon as the emotion caused by her last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>words had subsided a little; ‘and the things I know
are not of the “stuffing” kind!’</p>

<p class='c011'>It all made him think a good deal—this attitude
the children adopted towards <em>his</em> attitude, this unhesitating
acceptance of him in spite of all his
pretence. But he still valiantly maintained his
studied aloofness of manner, and never allowed
himself to overstep the danger line. He never
forgot himself when he played with them, and the
stories he told were just what they called “ornary”
stories, and not tales of pure imagination and
fantasy. The rules of the game, finely balanced,
were observed between them just as between himself
and Mrs. Tompkyns.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet somehow, by unregistered degrees and secretly,
they loosened the joints of his armour day by day
and hour by hour.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>All the Powers that vivify nature must be children, for all the fairies,
and gnomes, the goblins, yes, and the great giants too, are only different
sizes and shapes and characters of children.—<em>George MacDonald.</em></p>

<p class='c010'>It was a week later, and Paul was smoking his
evening pipe on the lawn before dinner. His sister
was in London for a couple of days. Mlle. Fleury
had gone to the dentist in the neighbouring town
and had not yet returned. The children, consequently,
had been running rather wild.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun had barely disappeared, when the full
moon, rising huge and faint in the east, cast a silvery
veil over the gardens and the wood. The night
came treading softly down the sky, passing with
an almost visible presence from the hills to the
motionless trees in the valley, and then sinking gently
and mysteriously down into the very roots of the
grass and flowers.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the day there had been rain—warm
showers alternating with dazzling sunshine as in
April—and now the earth, before going to sleep,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>was sending out great wafts of incense. Paul sniffed
it in with keen enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The odour of burning wood floated to him over
the tree-tops, hanging a little heavily in the moist
atmosphere; he thought of a hundred fires of his
own making—elsewhere, far away! ‘And grey
dawns saw his camp-fires in the rain,’ he murmured.</p>

<p class='c011'>He wandered down to the Larch Gate, so called
by the children because the larches stood there about
the entrance of the wood like the porch of some
forest temple. He halted, listening to the faint
drip-drip of the trees, and as he listened, he thought;
and his thoughts, like stones falling through a deep
sea, sank down into the depths of him where so little
light was that no words came to give them form or
substance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Overhead, the blue lanes of the sky down which
the sunlight had poured all day were slowly softening
for the coming of the stars; and in himself the
plastic depths, he felt, were a-stirring, as though
some great change that he could not alter or control
were about to take place in him. He was aware of
an unwonted undercurrent of excitement in his blood.
It seemed to him that there was ‘something afoot,’
although he had no evidence to warrant the suspicion.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Something’s up to-night,’ he murmured between
the puffs of his pipe. ‘There’s something in the
air!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He blew a long whiff of smoke and watched it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>melt away over a bed of mignonette among the blue
shadows where the dusk gathered beneath the ilex
trees. There, for a moment, his eye followed it, and
just as it sifted off into transparency he became aware
with a start of surprise that behind the bushes something
was moving. He looked closer.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s stopped,’ he muttered; ‘but only a second
ago it was moving—moving parallel with myself.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul was well accustomed to watching the motions
of wild creatures in the forest; his eye was trained
like the eye of an Indian. The gloom at first was
too dense for anything to differentiate itself from
their general mass, but after a short inspection his
sight detected little bits of shadow that were lighter
or darker than other little bits. The moving thing
began to assume outline.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s a person!’ he decided. ‘It’s somebody
watching—watching <em>me</em>!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He took a step forward, and the figure likewise
advanced, keeping even pace with him. He went
faster, and the figure also went faster; it moved very
silently, very softly, ‘like an Indian,’ he thought with
admiration. Behind the Blue Summer-house, where
they sometimes had tea on wet days, it disappeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There are no cattle-stealers, or timber-sneaks in
this country,’ he reflected, ‘but there are burglars.
Perhaps this is a burglar who knows Margaret is
away and thinks—’</p>

<p class='c011'>He had not time to finish what the burglar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>thought, for at that moment, at the top of the Long
Walk, where the moonlight already lay in a patch,
the figure suddenly dashed out at full speed from the
cover of the bushes, and he beheld, not a burglar,
but—a little girl in a blue frock with a broad white
collar, and long, black spindle legs.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nixie, my dear child!’ he exclaimed. ‘But
aren’t you in bed?’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a stupid question of course, and she did
not attempt to answer it, but came up close to him,
picking her way neatly between the flower-beds.
The moon gleamed on her shiny black shoes and on
her shiny yellow hair; over her summer dress she
wore a red cloak, but it was open and only held to
her by two thin bands about the neck. Under the
hood he saw her elf-like face, the expression grave,
but the eyes bright with excitement, and she moved
softly over the grass like a shadow, timidly, yet
without hesitation. A small, warm hand stole
into his.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul put his pipe, still alight, into his pocket
like a naughty boy caught smoking, and turned to
face her.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘’Pon my soul, Nixie, I believe you really <em>are</em>
a sprite!’</p>

<p class='c011'>She let go his hand and sprang away lightly over
the lawn, laughing silently, her hood dropping off
so that her hair flew out in a net to catch the moonlight,
and for an instant he imagined he was looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>at running water, swift and dancing; but the very
next second she was back at his side again, the red
hood replaced, the cloak gathered tightly about her
slim person, feeling for his big hand again with both
of her own.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘At night I <em>am</em> a sprite,’ she whispered laughing,
‘and mind I don’t bewitch you altogether!’</p>

<p class='c011'>She drew him gently across the lawn, choosing
the direction with evident purpose, and he, curiously
and suddenly bereft of all initiative, allowed her to
do as she would.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But, please, Uncle Paul,’ she went on with vast
gravity,’ I want you to be serious now. I’ve something
to say to you, and that’s why I’m not in bed
when I ought to be. All the other Sprites are
about too, you know, so be very careful how you
answer.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The big man allowed himself to be led away.
He felt his armour dropping off in great flakes as
he went. No light is so magical as in that mingled
hour of sun and moon when the west is still burning
and the east just a-glimmer with the glory that is to
come. Paul felt it strongly. He was half with the
sun and half with the moon, and the gates of fantasy
seemed somewhere close at hand. Curtains were
being drawn aside, veils lifting, doors softly opening.
He almost heard the rush of the wind behind, and
tasted the keen, sweet excitement of another world.</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned sharply to look at his companion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>But first he put the hood back, for she seemed more
human that way.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Well, child!’ he said, as gruffly as he could
manage, ‘and what is it you have stayed up so late
to ask me?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s something I have to say to you, not to <em>ask</em>,’
she replied at once demurely. There was a delicious
severity about her.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a pause of twenty seconds she tripped round
in front of him and stared full into his face. He
felt as though she cried ‘Hands up’ and held a six-shooter
to his head. She pulled the trigger that
same moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Isn’t it time now to stop writing all those Reports,
and to take off your dressing-up things?’ she
asked with decision.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul stopped abruptly and tried to disengage his
hand, but she held him so tightly that he could not
escape without violence.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What dressing-up things are you talking about?’
he asked, forcing a laugh which, he admitted
himself, sounded quite absurd.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘All this pretending that you’re so old, and don’t
know about things—I mean <em>real</em> things—<em>our</em> things.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He searched as in a fever for the right words—words
that should be true and wise, and safe—but
before he could pick them out of the torrent of
sentences that streamed through his mind, she had
gone on again. She spoke calmly, but very gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>‘We are <em>so</em> tired of helping to pretend with you;
and we’ve been waiting patiently <em>so</em> long. Even
Toby knows it’s only ’sguise you put on to
tease us.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Even Toby?’ he repeated foolishly, avoiding
her brilliant eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And it really isn’t quite fair, you know. There
are so very few that care—and understand—’</p>

<p class='c011'>There came a little quaver in her voice. She
hardly came up to his shoulder. He felt as though
a whole bathful of happiness had suddenly been upset
inside him, and was running about deliciously through
his whole being—as though he wanted to run and
dance and sing. It was like the reaction after tight
boots—collars—or tight armour—and the blood was
beginning to flow again mightily. Nothing could
stop it. Some keystone in the fabric of his being
dropped or shifted. His whole inner world fell into
a new pattern. Resistance was no longer possible or
desirable. He had done his best. Now he would
give in and enjoy himself at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But, my dear child—my dear little Nixie—’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘No, really, Uncle, there’s no good talking like
that,’ she interrupted, her voice under command
again, though still aggrieved, ‘because you know
quite well we’re all waiting for you to join us
properly—our Society, I mean—and have our
a’ventures with us—’</p>

<p class='c011'>She called it ‘aventures.’ She left out all consonants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>when excited. The word caught him sharply.
Nixie had wounded him better than she knew.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Er—then do you have adventures?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course—wonderful.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But not—er—the sort—er—I could join in?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course; very wonderfulindeedaventures.
That’s what Daddy used to call them—before he
went away.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Dick himself speaking. Paul imagined
he could hear the very voice. Another, and deeper,
emotion surged through him, making all the heartstrings
quiver.</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned and looked about him, still holding
the child tightly by the hand....</p>

<p class='c011'>Behind him he heard the air moving in the
larches, combing out their long green hair; the
pampas grass rustled faintly on the lawn just
beyond; and from the wood, now darkening, came
the murmur of the brook. On his right, the old
house looked shadowy and unreal. There stood
the chimneys, like draped figures watching him,
with the first stars peeping over their hunched
shoulders. Dew glistened on the slates of the roof;
beyond them he saw the clean outline of the hill,
darkly sweeping up into the pallor of the sunset.
There, too, past the wall of the house, he saw the
great distances of heathland moving down through
crowds of shadows to the sea. And the moon was
higher.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>‘There’s seats in the Blue Summer-house,’ the
voice beside him said, with insinuation as well as
command.</p>

<p class='c011'>He found it impossible to resist; indeed, the
very desire to resist had been spirited away. Slowly
they made their way across the silvery patchwork of
the lawn to the door of the Blue Summer-house.
This was a tumble-down structure with a thatched
roof; it had once been blue, but was now no colour
at all. Low seats ran round the inside walls, and as
Paul stood at the dark entrance he perceived that
these seats were already occupied; and he hesitated.
But Nixie pulled him gently in.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This is a regular Meeting,’ she said, as naturally
as though she had been wholly innocent of a part
in the plot. ‘They’ve only been waiting for us.
Please come in.’ She even pushed him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It may be regular, but it is most unexpected,’
he said, breathless rather, and curiously shy as he
crossed the threshold and peered round at the silent
faces about him. Eyes, he saw, were big and round
and serious, shining with excitement. Clearly it
was a very important occasion. He wondered what
an ‘irregular’ meeting would be like.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We waited till mother was away,’ explained a
candid voice, speaking with solemnity from the
recesses.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And till Madmerzelle had to go to the dentist
and stay to tea,’ added another.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>‘So that it would be easier for <em>you</em> to come,’
concluded Nixie, lest he should think all these
excuses were only on their own account.</p>

<p class='c011'>She led him across the cobbled floor to a wooden
arm-chair with crooked and shattered legs, and
persuaded him to sit down. He did so.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There was some sense in that, at any rate,’ he
remarked irrelevantly, not quite sure whether he
referred to the children, or Mademoiselle, or the
chair, and landing at the same instant with a crash
upon the rickety support which was much lower
than he thought it was. The joints and angles of
the wood entered his ribs. He lost all memory of
how to be sedate after that. He began to enjoy
himself absurdly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Silvery laughter was heard, followed immediately
by the sound of rushing little feet as a dozen small
shadows shot out into the moonlight and tore
across the lawn at top speed. China and Japan he
recognised, and a cohort of furry creatures in their
rear.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Now you’ve frightened them <em>all</em> away,’ exclaimed
the voice that had spoken first.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Doesn’t matter,’ replied the other, who evidently
spoke with authority; ‘Uncle Paul was in before
they left. They saw the introduction. That’s
enough. So now,’ it added with decision, ‘if you’re
quite ready we’d better begin.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul grasped by this time that he was the central
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>figure in some secret ceremony of the children, that
it was of vital importance to them, as well as a
profound compliment to himself. The animals
formed part of it so long as they could be persuaded
to stay. Their own rituals, however, were so vastly
more wonderful and dignified—especially the Ritual
of the Cats—that they were somewhat contemptuous,
and had escaped at the earliest opportunity. It was,
of course, his formal initiation into their world of
make-believe and imagination. He stood before
them on the floor of this tumbled-down Blue
Summer-house in the capacity of the Candidate.
Strange chills began to chase one another down his
long spine. A shy happiness swept through him
and made him shiver. ‘Can they possibly guess,’
he wondered, ‘how far more important this is to
me than to them?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Are you ready then?’ Nixie asked again.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Quite ready,’ he replied in a deep and tremulous
voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Go ahead then,’ said the voice of decision.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little bell rang, manipulated by some invisible
hand in the darkness, and Nixie darted forward and
drew a curtain that bore a close resemblance to a
carriage rug across the doorway, so that only the
faintest gleam of moonlight filtered through the
cracks on either side. Then the owner of the
voice of authority left his throne on the back wall
and stepped solemnly forward in the direction of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the candidate. Paul recognised Jonah with some
difficulty. He tripped twice on the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stumbling was comprehensible. On his head
he wore a sort of mitre that on ordinary occasions
was evidently used to keep the tea hot on the schoolroom
table; for it was beyond question a tea-cosy.
A garment of variegated colours wrapped his figure
down to the heels and trailed away some distance
behind him. It was either a table-cloth or a housemaid’s
Sunday dress, and it invested him with a
peculiar air of quaint majesty. He might have been
King of the Gnomes. On his hands were large
leathern gauntlets—very large indeed; and with
loose fingers whose movements were clearly difficult
to control, he grasped a stick that once may have
been a hunting crop, but now was certainly a wand
of office.</p>

<p class='c011'>In front of Paul he came to a full stop, gathering
his robes about him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He made a little bow, during which the mitre
shifted dangerously to one side, and then tapped
the candidate lightly with the wand on the head,
shoulders, and breast.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Please answer now,’ he said in a low tone, and
then went backwards to his seat against the wall.
His robe of office so impeded him that he was
obliged to use the wand as a common walking-stick.
Once or twice, too, he hopped.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But you’ve forgotten to ask it,’ whispered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Nixie from the door where she was holding up the
curtains with both hands. ‘He’s got nothing to
answer.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Quickly correcting his mistake, Jonah then stood
up on his seat and said, rather shyly, the following
lines, evidently learned by heart with a good deal of
trouble:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You’ve applied to our Secret Society,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which is full of unusual variety,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, in spite of your past,</div>
      <div class='line'>We admit you at last,</div>
      <div class='line'>But—we hope you’ll behave with propriety.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>‘Now, stand up and answer, please,’ whispered
Nixie. ‘Daddy made all this up, you know. It’s
your turn to answer now.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul rose with difficulty. At first it seemed as
if the chair meant to rise with him, so tightly did
it fit; but in the end he stood erect without it,
and bowing to the President, he said in solemn
tones—and the words came genuinely from his
heart:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I appreciate the honour done to me. I am very
grateful indeed.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s very good, I think,’ Nixie whispered
under her breath to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Toby advanced, climbing down laboriously
from her perch on the broken bench, and stalked
up to the spot just vacated by her brother. She,
too, was suitably dressed for the occasion, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>owing to her diminutive size, and the fact that
she did not reach up to the patch of moonlight,
it was not possible to distinguish more than the
white cap pinned on to her hair. It looked like
a housekeeper’s cap. She, too, carried a wand of
office. Was it a hunting crop or poker, Paul
wondered?</p>

<p class='c011'>Toby, then, with much more effort than Jonah,
repeated the formula of admission. She got the
lines a little mixed, however:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You’ve applied to our Secret Society,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which is full of unusual propriety,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, in spite of your past,</div>
      <div class='line'>We admit you at last,</div>
      <div class='line'>But we hope you’ll <em>behave with variety</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>‘I will endeavour to do so,’ said Paul, replying
with a low bow.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he rose again to an upright position, Nixie
was standing close in front of him. One arm still
held up the curtains, but the other pointed directly
into his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Your ’ficial position in the Society,’ she said in
her thin, musical little voice, also repeating words
learned by heart, ‘will be that of Recording Secretary,
and your principal duties to keep a record of all
the Aventures and to read them aloud at Regular
Meetings. Any Meeting anywhere is a Regular
Meeting. You must further promise on your living
oath not to reveal the existence of the Society, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>any detail of its proceedings, to any person not
approved of by the Society as a whole.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She paused for his reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I promise,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘He promises,’ repeated three voices together.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a general clatter and movement in
the summer-house. He was forced down again into
the rickety chair and the three little officials were
clambering upon his knees before he knew where
he was. All talked breathlessly at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Now you’re in properly—at last!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You needn’t pretend any more——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But we knew all along you were really trying
hard to get in?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I really believe I was,’ said he, getting in a
chance remark.</p>

<p class='c011'>They covered him with kisses.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We never thought you were as important as
you pretended,’ Jonah said; ‘and your being so
big made no difference.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Or your beard, Uncle Paul,’ added Toby.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And we never think people old till they’re
married,’ Jonah explained, putting the mitre on his
uncle’s head.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So now we can have our aventures all together,’
exclaimed Nixie, kissing him swiftly, and leaping
off his knee. The other two followed her example,
and suddenly—he never quite understood how it
happened so quickly—the summer-house was empty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and he was alone with the moonlight. A flash of
white petticoats and slender black legs on the lawn,
and lo, they were gone!</p>

<p class='c011'>On the gravel path outside sounded a quick step.
Paul started with surprise. The very next minute
Mlle. Fleury, in her town clothes and hat, appeared
round the corner.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘’Ow then!’ she exclaimed sharply, ‘the little
ones zey are no more ’ere? Mr Rivairs...!’
She shook her finger at him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul tried to look dignified. For the moment,
however, he quite forgot the tea-cosy still balanced
on his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Mademoiselle Fleury,’ he said politely, ‘the
children have gone to bed.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It is ’igh time that they are already in bed,
only I hear their voices now this minute,’ she went
on excitedly. ‘They ’ide here, do they not?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I assure you, Mademoiselle, they have gone to
bed,’ Paul said. The woman stared at him with
amazement in her eyes. He wondered why. Then,
with a crash, something fell from the skies, hitting
his nose on the way down, and bounding on to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, the mitre!’ he cried with a laugh, ‘I clean
forgot it was there.’ He kicked it aside and stared
with confusion at his companion. She looked very
neat and trim in her smart town frock. He understood
now why she stared so, and his cheeks flamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>crimson, though it was too dark for them to be
seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Meester Reevairs,’ she said at length, the desire
to laugh and the desire to scold having fought
themselves to a standstill, so that her face betrayed
no expression at all, ‘you lead zem astray, I think.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘On the contrary, it is they who lead me,’ he said
self-consciously. ‘In fact, they have just deprived
me of my very best armour——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Armour!’ she interrupted, ‘<i><span lang="fr">Armoire</span></i>! Ah!
They ’ide upstairs in the cupboard,’—and she turned
to run.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Do not be harsh with them,’ he cried after her,
‘it is all my fault really. I am to blame, not
they.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘’Arsh! Oh no!’ she called back to him.
‘Only, you know, if your seester find them at this
hour not in bed——’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul lost the end of the sentence as she turned
the corner of the house. He gathered up the
remnants of the ceremony and followed slowly in
her footsteps.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Now, really,’ he thought, ‘what a simple and
charming woman! How her eyes twinkled! And
how awfully nice her voice was!’ He flung down
the rugs and wands and tea-cosy in the hall. ‘Out
there,’ with a jerk in the direction of the Atlantic
Ocean, ‘the whole camp would make her a Queen.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Altogether the excitement of the last hour had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>been considerable. He felt that something must
happen to him unless he could calm down a bit.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I know,’ he exclaimed aloud, ‘I’ll go and have
a hot bath. There’s just time before dinner.
That’ll take it out of me.’ And he went up the
front stairs, singing like a boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>For some days after that Paul walked on air.
Incredible as it may seem to normally constituted
persons, he was so delighted to have found a medium
in which he could in some measure express himself
without fear of ridicule, that the entire world was
made anew for him. He thought about it a great
deal. He even argued in his muddled fashion, but
he got no farther that way. The only thing he
really understood was the plain fact that he had
found a region where his companions were about his
own age, with his own tastes, ready to consider
things that were <em>real</em>, and to let the trivial and
vulgar world go by.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the fact that stared him in the face and
made him happy. For the first time in his life he
could play with others. Hitherto he had played
alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s a safety-valve at last,’ he exclaimed, using
his favourite word. ‘Now I can let myself go a bit.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span><em>They</em> will never laugh; on the contrary, they’ll
understand and love it. Hooray!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And, remember,’ Nixie had again explained to
him, ‘you have to write down all the aventures.
That’s what keeping the records means. And you
must read them out to us at the Meetings.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And he chuckled as he thought about it, for it
meant having real Reports to write at last, reports
that others would read and appreciate.</p>

<p class='c011'>The aventures, moreover, began very quickly;
they came thick and fast; and he lived in them so
intensely that he carried them over into his other
dull world, and sometimes hardly knew which world
he was in at all. His imagination, hungry and untamed,
had escaped, and was seeking all it could
devour.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a hot afternoon in mid-June, and Paul
was lying with his pipe upon the lawn. His sister
was out driving. He was alone with the children
and the smaller portion of the menagerie,—smaller
in size, that is, not in numbers; cats, kittens, and
puppies were either asleep, or on the hunt, all about
them. And from an open window a parrot was
talking ridiculously in mixed French and English.</p>

<p class='c011'>The giant cedars spread their branches; in the
limes the bees hummed drowsily; the world lay
a scented garden around him, and a very soft wind
stole to and fro, stirring the bushes with sleepy
murmurs and making the flowers nod.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>China and Japan lay panting in the shade behind
him, and not far off reposed the big grey Persian,
Mrs. Tompkyns. Regardless of the heat, Pouf,
Zezette, and Dumps flitted here and there as though
the whole lawn was specially made for their games;
and Smoke, the black cat, dignified and mysterious,
lay with eyes half-closed just near enough for Paul
to stroke his sleek, hot sides when he felt so disposed.
He—Smoke that is—blinked indifferently at passing
butterflies, or twitched his great tail at the very tip
when a bird settled in the branches overhead; but
for the most part he was intent upon other matters—matters
of genuine importance that concerned
none but himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few yards off Jonah and Toby were doing
something with daisies—what it was Paul could not
see; and on his other side Nixie lay flat upon the
grass and gazed into the sky. The governess was—where
all governesses should be out of lesson-time—elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nixie, you’re sleeping. Wake up.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She rolled over towards him. ‘No, Uncle Paul,
I’m not. I was only thinking.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Thinking of what?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, clouds and things; chiefly clouds, I think.’
She pointed to the white battlements of summer
that were passing very slowly over the heavens.
‘It’s so funny that you can see them move, yet
can’t see the thing that pushes them along.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>‘Wind, you mean?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘H’mmmmm.’</p>

<p class='c011'>They lay flat on their backs and watched. Nixie
made a screen of her hair and peered through it.
Paul did the same with his fingers.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You can touch it, and smell it, and hear it,’ she
went on, half to herself, ‘but you can’t <em>see</em> it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I suspect there are creatures that can see the
wind, though,’ he remarked sleepily.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I ’spect so too,’ she said softly. ‘I think I could,
if I really tried hard enough. If I was very, oh
very kind and gentle and polite to it, I think——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Come and tell me quietly,’ Paul said with
excitement. ‘I believe you’re right.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He scented a delightful aventure. The child
turned over on the grass twice, roller fashion, and
landed against him, lying on her face with her chin
in her hands and her heels clicking softly in the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>She began to explain what she meant. ‘You
must listen properly because it’s rather difficult to
explain, you know’; he heard her breathing into his
ear, and then her voice grew softer and fainter as
she went on. Lower and lower it grew, murmuring
like a distant mill-wheel, softer and softer; wonderful
sentences and words all running gently into each
other without pause, somewhere below ground. It
began to sound far away, and it melted into the
humming of the bees in the lime trees.... Once
or twice it stopped altogether, Paul thought, so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>he missed whole sentences.... Gaps came, gaps
filled with no definite words, but only the inarticulate
murmur of summer and summer life....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, without warning, he became conscious of a
curious sinking sensation, as though the solid lawn
beneath him had begun to undulate. The turf grew
soft like air, and swam up over him in green waves till
his head was covered. His ears became muffled;
Nixie’s voice no longer reached him as something
outside himself; it was within—curiously running, so
to speak, with his blood. He sank deeper and deeper
into a delicious, soothing medium that both covered
and penetrated him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The child had him by the hand, that was all he
knew, then—a long sliding motion, and forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m off,’ he remembered thinking, ‘off at last
into a real aventure!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Down they sank, down, down; through soft
darkness, and long, shadowy places, passing through
endless scented caverns, and along dim avenues that
stretched, for ever and ever it seemed, beneath the
gloom of mighty trees. The air was cool and
perfumed with earth. They were in some underworld,
strangely muted, soundless, mysterious. It
grew very dark.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Where are we, Nixie?’ He did not feel alarm;
but a sense of wonder, touched delightfully by awe,
had begun to send thrills along his nerves.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Her reply in his ear was like a voice in a tiny
trumpet, far away, very soft. ‘Come along!
Follow me!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m coming. But it’s so dark.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Hush,’ she whispered. ‘We’re in a dream together.
I’m not sure where exactly. Keep close
to me.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m coming,’ he repeated, blundering over the
roots beside her; ‘but where are we? I can’t see
a bit.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Tread softly. We’re in a lost forest—just
before the dawn,’ he heard her voice answer faintly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘A forest underground——? You mean a coal
measure?’ he asked in amazement.</p>

<p class='c011'>She made no answer. ‘I think we’re going to
see the wind,’ she added presently.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her words thrilled him inexplicably. It was
as if—in that other world of gross values—some one
had said, ‘You’re going to make a million!’ It
was all hushed and soft and subdued. Everything
had a coating of plush.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We’ve gone backwards somewhere—a great
many years. But it’s all right. There’s no time
in dreams.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s dreadfully dark,’ he whispered, tripping
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>The persuasion of her little hand led him along
over roots and through places of deep moss. Great
spaces, he felt, were about him. Shadows coated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>everything with silence. It was like the vast
primeval forests of his country across the seas. The
map of the world had somehow shifted, and here,
in little England, he found the freedom of those
splendid scenes of desolation that he craved.
Millions of huge trees reared up about them through
the gloom, and he felt their presence, though invisible.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The sun isn’t up yet,’ she added after a bit.
He held her hand tightly, as they stumbled slowly
forward together side by side. He began to feel
extraordinarily alive. Exhilaration seized him. He
could have shouted with excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Hush!’ whispered his guide, ‘<em>do</em> be careful.
You’ll upset us both.’ The trembling of his hand
betrayed him. ‘You stumble like an om’ibus!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m all right. Go ahead!’ he replied under his
breath. ‘I can see better now!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Now look,’ she said, stopping in front of him
and turning round.</p>

<p class='c011'>The darkness lifted somewhat as he bent down
to follow the direction of her gaze. On every side,
dim and thronging, he saw the stems of immense
trees rising upwards into obscurity. There were
hundreds upon hundreds of them. His eyes
followed their outline till the endless number bewildered
him. Overhead, the stars were shining
faintly through the tangled network of their
branches. Odours of earth and moss and leaves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>cool and delicate, rose about them; vast depths of
silence stretched away in every direction. Great
ferns stood motionless, with all the magic of frosted
window-panes, among their roots. All was still and
dark and silent. It was the heart of a great forest
before the dawn—prehistoric, unknown to man.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, I wonder—I wonder——’ began Paul,
groping about him clumsily with his hands to feel
the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, please don’t talk so loud,’ Nixie whispered,
pinching his arm; ‘we shall wake up if you do.
Only people in dreams come to places like this.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You know the place?’ he exclaimed with increasing
excitement. ‘So do I almost. I’m sure
this has all happened before, only I can’t remember——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We must keep as still as mice.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We are—still as mice.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This is where the winds sleep when they’re not
blowing. It’s their resting-place.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked about him, drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Look out; you’ll wake them if you breathe like
<em>that</em>,’ whispered the child.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Are they asleep now?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course. Can’t you see?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not much—yet!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Move like a cat, and speak in whispers. We
may see them when they wake.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘How soon?’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>‘Dawn. The wind always wakes with the sun.
It’s getting closer now.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was very wonderful. No words can describe
adequately the still splendour of that vast forest
as they stood there, waiting for the sunrise. Nothing
stirred. The trees were carved out of some
marvellous dream-stuff, motionless, yet conveying
the impression of life. Paul knew it and recognised
it. All primeval woods possess that quality—trees
that know nothing of men and have never heard
the ringing of the axe. The silence was of death,
yet a sense of life that is far beyond death pulsed
through it. Cisterns of quiet, gigantic, primitive
life lay somewhere hidden in these shadowed glades.
It seemed the counterpart of a man’s soul before
rude passion and power have stirred it into activity.
Here all slept potentially, as in a human soul. The
huge, sombre pines rose from their beds of golden
moss to shake their crests faintly to the stars,
awaiting the coming of the true passion—the great
Sun of life, that should call them to splendour,
to reality, and to the struggle of a bigger life
than they yet knew, when they might even try
to shake free from their roots in the hard, confining
earth, and fly to the source of their existence—the
sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the sun was coming now. The dawn was
at hand. The trees moved gently together, it
seemed. The wood grew lighter. An almost imperceptible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>shudder ran through it as through a
vast spider’s web.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Look!’ cried Nixie. His simple, intuitive
little guide was nearer, after all, to reality than he
was, for all his subtle vision. ‘Look, Uncle Paul!’</p>

<p class='c011'>His attempt to analyse wonder had prevented
his seeing it sooner, but as she spoke he became
aware that something very unusual was going forward
about them. His skin began to tickle, and
a strange sense of excitement took possession of
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>A pale, semi-transparent substance he saw hung
everywhere in the air about them, clinging in spirals
and circles to the trunks, and hanging down from
the branches in long slender ribbons that reached
almost to the ground. The colour was a delicate
pearl-grey. It covered everything as with the
softest of filtered light, and hung motionless in
the air in painted streamers of thinnest possible
vapour.</p>

<p class='c011'>The silken threads of these gossamer ribbons
dropped from the sky in millions upon millions.
They wrapped themselves round the very star-beams,
and lay in sheets upon the ground; they
curled themselves round the stones and crept in
among the tiniest crevices of moss and bark; they
clothed the ferns with their fairy gauze. Paul could
even feel them coiling about his hair and beard and
eyelashes. They pervaded the entire scene as light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>does. The colour was uniform; whether in sheets
or ribbons, it did not vary in shade or in degree of
transparency. The entire atmosphere was pervaded
by it, frozen into absolute stillness.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s the winds—all that stuff,’ Nixie
whispered, her voice trembling with excitement.
‘They’re asleep still. Aren’t they awful and
wonderful?’</p>

<p class='c011'>As she spoke a faint vibration ran everywhere
through the ribbons. Involuntarily he tightened his
grasp on the child’s hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s their beginning to wake,’ she said,
drawing closer to him, ‘like people moving in sleep.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The vibration ran through the air again. It
quivered as reflections in the surface of a pool
quiver to a ghost of passing wind. They seated
themselves on a fallen trunk and waited. The trees
waited too; as gigantic notes in a set piece, Paul
thought, that the coming sun would presently play
upon like a hand upon a vast instrument. Then
something moved a few feet away, and he jumped
in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Only Jonah,’ explained his guide. ‘He’s asleep
like us. Don’t wake him; he’s having a dream
too.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was indeed Jonah, wandering vaguely this way
and that, disappearing and reappearing, wholly unaware,
it seemed, of their presence. He looked like
a gnome. His feet made no sound as he moved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>about, and after a few minutes he lost himself behind
a big trunk and they saw him no more. But
almost at once behind him the round figures of
China and Japan emerged into view. They came,
moving fast and busily, blundering against the trees,
tumbling down, and butting into everything that
came in their path as though they could not see
properly. Paul watched them with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They’re only half asleep, and that’s why they see
so badly,’ Nixie told him. ‘Aren’t they silly and
happy?’</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he could answer, something else moved
into their limited field of vision, and he was aware
that a silent grey shadow was stalking solemnly by.
All dignity and self-confidence it was; stately,
proud, sure of itself, in a region where it was at
home, conscious of its power to see and move better
than any one else. Two wide-open and brilliant eyes,
shining like dropped stars, were turned for a moment
towards them where they sat on the log and watched.
Then, silent and beautiful, it passed on into the darkness
beyond, and vanished from their sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Mrs. Tompkyns!’ whispered Nixie. ‘<em>She</em> saw
us all right!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Splendid!’ he exclaimed under his breath, full
of admiration.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie pinched his arm. A change had come
about in the last few minutes, and into this dense
forest the light of approaching dawn began to steal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>most wonderfully. A universal murmuring filled
the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The sun’s coming. They’re going to wake
now!’ The child gave a little shiver of delight.
Paul sat up. A general, indefinable motion, he saw,
was beginning everywhere to run to and fro among
the hanging streamers. More light penetrated every
minute, and the tree stems began to turn from black
to purple, and then from purple to faint grey.
Vistas of shadowy glades began to open up on all
sides; every instant the trees stood out more distinctly.
The myriad threads and ribbons were
astir.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Look!’ cried the child aloud; ‘they’re uncurling
as they wake.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked. The sense of wonder and beauty
moved profoundly in his heart. Where, oh where,
in all the dreams of his solitary years had he seen
anything to equal this unearthly vision of the awakening
winds?</p>

<p class='c011'>The winds moved in their sleep, and awoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>In loops, folds, and spirals of indescribable grace
they slowly began to unwrap themselves from the
tree stems with a million little delicate undulations;
like thin mist trembling, and then smoothing out the
ruffled surface of their thousand serpentine eddies,
they slid swiftly upwards from the moss and ferns,
disentangled themselves without effort from roots
and stones and bark, and then, reinforced by countless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>thousands from the lower branches, they rose up
slowly in vast coloured sheets towards the region of
the tree-tops.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, as they rose, the silence of the forest passed
into sound—trembling and murmuring at first, and
then rapidly increasing in volume as the distant
glades sent their voices to swell it, and the note of
every hollow and dell joined in with its contributory
note. From all the shadowy recesses of the wood
they heard it come, louder and louder, leaping to
the centre like running great arpeggios, and finally
merging all lesser notes in the wave of a single
dominant chord—the song of the awakened winds
to the dawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They’re singing to the sun,’ Nixie whispered.
Her voice caught in her throat a little and she
tightened her grasp on his big hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They’re changing colour too,’ he answered
breathlessly. They stood up on their log to see.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s the rate they go does that,’ she tried to
explain. She stood on tiptoe.</p>

<p class='c011'>He understood what she meant, for he now saw
that as the wind rose in ribbons, streams and spirals,
the original pearl-grey changed chromatically into
every shade of colour under the sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Same as metals getting hot,’ she said. ‘Their
colour comes ’cording to their speed.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of the tints he found it impossible to
name, for they were such as he had never dreamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of. Crimsons, purples, soft yellows, exquisite greens
and pinks ran to and fro in a perfect deluge of
colour, as though a hundred sunsets had been let
loose and were hunting wildly for the West to set
in. And there were shades of opal and mother-of-pearl
so delicate that he could only perceive them
in his bewildered mind by translating them into the
world of sound, and imagining it was the colour of
their own singing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Far too rapidly for description they changed their
protean dress, moving faster and faster, glowing
fiercely one minute and fading away the next, passing
swiftly into new and dazzling brilliancies as the
distant winds came to join them, and at length
rushing upwards in one huge central draught through
the trees, shouting their song with a roar like the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly they swept up into the sky—sound,
colour and all—and silence once more descended
upon the forest. The winds were off and about their
business of the day. The woods were empty. And
the sun was at the very edge of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Watch the tops of the trees now,’ cried Nixie,
still trembling from the strange wonder of the scene.
‘The Little Winds will wake the moment the sun
touches them—the little winds in the tops of the
trees.’</p>

<p class='c011'>As she spoke, the sun came up and his first
rays touched the pointed crests above them with
gold; and Paul noticed that there were thousands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of tiny, slender ribbons streaming out like elastic
threads from the tips of all the pines, and that these
had only just begun to move. As at a word of
command they trooped out to meet the sunshine,
undulating like wee coloured serpents, and uttering
their weird and gentle music at the same time. And
Paul, as he listened, understood at last why the wind
in the tree-tops is always more delicately sweet than
any other kind, and why it touches so poignantly the
heart of him who hears, and calls wonder from her
deepest lair.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The young winds, you see,’ Nixie said, peering
up beneath her joined hands and finding it difficult
to keep her balance as she did so. ‘They sleep
longer than the others. And they’re not loose
either; they’re fastened on, and can only go out
and come back.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And, as he watched, he saw these young winds fly
out miles into the brightening sky, making lines of
flashing colour, and then tear back with a whirring
rush of music to curl up again round the twigs and
pine needles.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Though sometimes they <em>do</em> manage to get loose,
and make funny storms and hurricanes and things
that no one expects at all in the sky.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul was on the point of replying to this explanation
when something struck against his legs, and he
only just saved himself from falling by seizing Nixie
and risking a flying leap with her from the log.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>‘It’s that wicked Japan again,’ she laughed,
clambering back on to the tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>The puppy was vigorously chasing its own tail,
bumping as it did so into everything within reach.
Paul stooped to catch it. At the same instant it
rose up past his very nose, and floated off through
the trees and was lost to view in the sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie laughed merrily. ‘It woke in the middle
of its silly little dream,’ she said. ‘It was only half asleep
really, and playing. It won’t come back now.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘All puppies are absurd like that——’</p>

<p class='c011'>But he did not finish his profound observation
about puppies, for his voice at that moment was
drowned in a new and terrible noise that seemed to
come from the heart of the wood. It happened just
as in a children’s fairy tale. It bore no resemblance
to the roar the winds made; there was no music in
it; it was crude in quality—angry; a sound from
another place.</p>

<p class='c011'>It came swiftly nearer and nearer, increasing in
volume as it came. A veil seemed to spread
suddenly over the scene; the trees grew shadowy
and dim; the glades melted off into mistiness; and
ever the mass of sound came pouring up towards
them. Paul realised that the frontiers of consciousness
were shifting again in a most extraordinary
fashion, so that the whole forest slipped off into
the background and became a dim map in his
memory, faint and unreal—and, with it, went both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Nixie and himself. The ground rose and fell under
their feet. Her hand melted into something fluid
and slippery as he tried to keep his hold upon it.
The child whispered words he could not catch.
Then, like the puppy, they both began to rise.</p>

<p class='c011'>The roar came out to meet them and enveloped
them furiously in mid air.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘At any rate, we’ve seen the wind!’ he heard
the child’s voice murmuring in his beard. She rose
away from him, being lighter, and vanished through
the tops of the trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then the roar drowned him and swept him
away in a whirling tempest, so that he lost all
consciousness of self and forgot everything he had
ever known....</p>

<p class='c010'>The noise resolved itself gradually into the
crunching sounds of the carriage wheels and the
clatter of horses’ hoofs coming up the gravel drive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul looked about him with a sigh that was half
a yawn. China and Japan were still romping on the
lawn, Mrs. Tompkyns and Smoke were curled up
in hot, soft circles precisely where they had been
before, Toby and Jonah were still busily engaged
doing ‘something with daisies’ in the full blaze of
the sunshine, and Nixie lay beside him, all innocence
and peace, still gazing through the tangle of her
yellow hair at the slow-sailing clouds overhead.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the clouds, he noticed, had hardly altered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>a line of their shape and position since he saw them
last.</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned with a jump of excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nixie,’ he exclaimed, ‘I’ve seen the wind!’</p>

<p class='c011'>She rolled over lazily on her side and fixed her
great blue eyes on his own, between two strands of
her hair. From the expression of her brown face it
was possible to surmise that she knew nothing—and
everything.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Have you?’ she said very quietly. ‘I thought
you might.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes, but did I dream it, or imagine it, or just
think it and make it up?’ He still felt a little
bewildered; the memory of that strangely beautiful
picture-gallery still haunted him. Yonder, before
the porch, the steaming horses and the smart coachman
on the box, and his sister coming across the
lawn from the carriage all belonged to another world,
while he himself and Nixie and the other children
still stayed with him, floating in a golden atmosphere
where Wind was singing and alive.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That doesn’t matter a bit,’ she replied, peering
at him gravely before she pulled her hair over both
eyes. ‘The point is that it’s really true! Now,’
she added, her face completely hidden by the yellow
web, ‘all you have to do is to write it for our next
Meeting—write the record of your Aventure——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And read it out?’ he said, beginning to understand.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>The yellow head nodded. He felt utterly and
delightfully bewitched.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘All right,’ he said; ‘I will.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And make it a very-wonderfulindeed Aventure,’
she added, springing to her feet. ‘Hush! Here’s
mother!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul rose dizzily to greet his sister, while the
children ran off with their animals to other things.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You’ve had a pleasant afternoon, Paul, dear?’
she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, very nice indeed——’ His thoughts were
still entangled with the wind and with the story he
meant to write about it for the next Meeting.</p>

<p class='c011'>She opened her parasol and held it over her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Now, come indoors,’ he went on, collecting
himself with an effort, ‘or into the shade. This
heat is not good for you, Margaret.’ He looked
at her pale, delicate face. ‘You’re tired too.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I enjoyed the drive,’ she replied, letting him
take her arm and lead her towards the house. ‘I
met the Burdons in their motor. They’re coming
over to luncheon one day, they said. You’ll like
<em>him</em>, I think.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s very nice,’ he remarked again, ‘very
nice. Margaret,’ he exclaimed suddenly, ashamed of
his utter want of interest in all she was planning for
him, ‘I think you ought to have a motor too. I’m
going to give you one.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That is sweet of you, Paul,’ she smiled at him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>‘But really, you know, one likes horses best.
They’re much quieter. Motors do shake one so.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I don’t think that matters; the point is that it’s
really true,’ he muttered to himself, thinking of
Nixie’s judgment of his Aventure.</p>

<p class='c011'>His sister looked at him with her expression of
faint amusement.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You mustn’t mind me,’ he laughed, planting
her in a deck-chair by the shade of the house; ‘but
the truth is, my mind is full just now of some work
I’ve got to do—a report, in fact, I’ve got to write.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He went off into the house, humming a song.
She followed him with her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘He is so strange. I do wish he would see more
people and be a little more normal.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And in Paul’s mind, as he raced along the passage
to his private study in search of pen and paper, there
ran a thought of very different kind in the shape of
a sentence from the favourite of all his books:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Everything possible to be believed is an image
of truth.’</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It is said that a poet has died young in the breast of the most
stolid. It may be contended, rather, that this (somewhat minor bard)
in almost every case survives, and is the spice of life to his possessor.—R. L. S.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now that his first Aventure was an accomplished
fact, and that he was writing it out for the Meeting,
Paul carried about with him a kind of secret joy.
At last he had found an audience, and an audience
is unquestionably a very profound need of every
human heart. Nixie was helping him to expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’ll write them such an Aventure out of that
Wind-Vision,’ he exclaimed, ‘that they’ll fairly
shiver with delight. And if <em>they</em> shiver, why
shouldn’t all the children in the world shiver too?’</p>

<p class='c011'>He no longer made the mistake of thinking it
trivial; if he could find an audience of children all
about the world, children known or unknown, to
whom he could show his little gallery of pictures,
what could be more reasonable or delightful? What
could be more useful and worth doing than to show
the adventuring mind some meaning in all the
beauty that filled his heart? And the Wind-Vision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>might be a small—a very small, beginning. It might
be the first of a series of modern fairy tales. The
idea thrilled him with pleasure. ‘A safety-valve at
last!’ he cried. ‘An audience that won’t laugh!’</p>

<p class='c011'>For, in reality, there was also a queer motherly
quality in him which he had always tried more or
less successfully to hide, and of which, perhaps, he
was secretly half ashamed—a feeling that made him
long to give of his strength and sympathy to all
that was helpless, weary, immature.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went about the house like a new man, for
in proportion as he allowed his imagination to use
its wings, life became extraordinarily alive. He
sang, and the world sang with him. Everything
turned up little smiling faces to him, whispering
fairy contributions to his tale.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The more I give out, the more I get in,’ he
laughed. ‘I declare it’s quite wonderful,’ as though
he had really discovered a new truth all for himself.
New forces began to course through his veins like
fire. As in a great cistern tapped for the first time,
this new outlet produced other little cross-currents
everywhere throughout his being. Paul began to
find a new confidence. Another stone had shifted
in the fabric of his soul. He moved one stage
nearer to the final pattern that it had been intended
from the beginning of time he should assume.</p>

<p class='c011'>A world within a world began to grow up in
the old grey house under the hill, one consisting of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Nixie and her troupe, with Paul trailing heavily in
the rear, very eager; and the other, of the grown-up
members of the household, with Mlle. Fleury
belonging to neither, yet in a sense belonging to
both. The cats and animals again were in the
former—an inner division of it, so that it was like
a series of Chinese boxes, each fitting within the
next in size.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this admission of Paul into the innermost
circle produced a change in the household, as well
as in himself. After all, the children had not betrayed
him; they had only divined his secret and
put him right with himself. But this was everything;
and who is there with a vestige of youth
in his spirit that will not understand the cause of
his mysterious exhilaration?</p>

<p class='c011'>Outwardly, of course, no definite change was
visible in the doings of the little household. The
children said little; they made no direct reference
to his conversion; but the change, though not
easily described, was felt by all. Paul recognised
it in every fibre of his being. Every one, he
noticed, understood by some strange freemasonry
that he had been initiated, for every one, he fancied,
treated him a little differently. It was natural that
the children should give signs of increased admiration
and affection for their huge new member, but
there was no obvious reason why his sister, and the
servants, and the very animals into the bargain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>should regard him with a strain of something that
hesitated between tolerance and tenderness.</p>

<p class='c011'>If truth were told, they probably did nothing
of the sort; it was his own point of view that had
changed. His imagination was responsible for the
rest; yet he felt as though he had been caught into
the heart of a great conspiracy, and the silent,
unobtrusive way every one played his, her, or its
part contrived to make him think it was all very
real indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cats, furry and tender magicians that they
are, perhaps interpreted the change more skilfully
and easily than any one else. Without the least
fuss or ceremony they made him instantly free of
their world, and the way their protection and encouragement
were extended to him in a hundred
gentle ways gave him an extraordinarily vivid impression
that they, too, had their plans and
conferences just as much as the children had.
They made everything seem alive and intelligent,
from the bushes where they hunted to the furniture
where they slept. They brought the whole world,
animate and inanimate, into his scheme of existence.
Everything had life, though not the same degree
of life. It was all very subtle and wonderful.
He, and the children, and the cats, all had imagination
according to their kind and degree, and all
equally used it to make the world haunted and
splendid.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Formerly, for instance, he had often surprised
Mrs. Tompkyns going about in the passages on
secret business of her own, perhaps not altogether
good, yet looking up with an <em>assumption</em> of
innocence that made it quite impossible to chide
or interfere. (It was, of course, only an assumption
of innocence. A cat’s eyes are too intent and
purposeful for genuine innocence; they are a mask,
a concealment of a thousand plans.) But now,
when he met her, she at once stopped and sent her
tail aloft by way of signal, and came to rub against
his legs. Her eyes smiled—that pregnant, significant
smile of the feline, shown by mere blinking of the
lids—and she walked slowly by his side with arched
back, as an invitation that he might—nay, that he
should—accompany her.</p>

<p class='c011'>On her great, dark journeys he might not of
course yet go, but on the smaller, less important
expeditions he was welcome, and she showed it
plainly every time they met. He was led politely
to numerous cupboards, corners, attics, and cellars,
whose existence he had not hitherto suspected.
There were wonderful and terrible places among
the book-shelves and under massive pieces of
furniture which she showed to him when no one
was about; and she further taught him how to sit
and stare for long periods until out of vacancy there
issued a series of fascinating figures and scenes of
strange loveliness. And he, laughing, obeyed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>All this, and much else besides, they taught him
cleverly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of them, too, came to visit him in his own
quarters. They came into his study, and into his
bedroom, and one of them—that black, thick-haired
fellow called Smoke—the one with the ghostly eyes
and very furry trousers—even took to tapping at
his door late at night (by standing on tiptoe he
could just reach the knob), and thus established
the right to sleep on the sofa or even to curl up
on the foot of the bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>And all that the kittens, the puppies, and the
out-of-door animals did to teach him as an equal
is better left untold, since this is a story and not
a work on natural history.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mlle. Fleury, the little French governess, alone
seemed curiously out of the picture. She made
difficulties here and there, though not insuperable
ones. The fact was, he saw, that she was not
properly in either of the two worlds. She wanted
to be in both at once, but, from the very nature of
her position, succeeded in getting into neither; and
to fall between two worlds is far more perplexing
than to fall between two stools. Paul made allowances
for her just as he might have made allowances
for an over-trained animal that had learned too
many human-taught tricks to make its presence
quite acceptable to its own four-footed circle. The
charming little person—he, at least, always thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>her voice and her manners and her grace charming
after a life where these were unknown—had to
justify herself to the grown-up world where his
sister belonged, as well as to the world of the
children whom she taught. And, consequently, she
was often compelled to scold when, perhaps, her soul
cried out that she should bless.</p>

<p class='c011'>His heart always hammered, if ever so slightly,
when he made his way, as he now did more and
more frequently, to the schoolroom or the nursery.
Schoolroom-tea became a pleasure of almost irresistible
attractions, and when it was over and the
governess was legitimately out of the way, Nixie
sometimes had a trick of announcing a Regular
Meeting to which Paul was called upon to read out
his latest ‘Aventure.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Hulloa! Having tea, are you?’ he exclaimed,
looking in at the door one afternoon shortly after
the wind episode. This feigned surprise, which
deceived nobody, he felt was admirable. It was
exactly the way Mrs. Tompkyns did it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Come in, Uncle Paul. <em>Do</em> stay. You <em>must</em>
stay,’ came the chorus, while Mlle. Fleury half
smiled, half frowned at him across the table.
‘Here’s just the stodgy kind of cake you like,
with jam <em>and</em> honey!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Well,’ he said hesitatingly, as though he scorned
such things, while Mademoiselle poured out a cup,
and the children piled up a plate for him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>He stayed, as it were, by chance, and a minute
later was as earnestly engaged with the cake and
tea as if he had come with that special purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s all very well done,’ was his secret thought.
‘It’s exactly the way Mrs. Tompkyns manages all
her most important affairs.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<span lang="fr">Nous avons réunion après</span>,’ Jonah informed the
governess presently with a very grave face. The
young woman glanced interrogatively at Paul.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<span lang="fr">Oui, oui</span>,’ he said in his Canadian French, ‘<span lang="fr">c’est
vrai. Réunion régulaire</span>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<span lang="fr">Mais qu’elle idée, donc!</span>’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<span lang="fr">Il est le président</span>,’ said Toby indignantly,
pointing with a jam sandwich.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<span lang="fr">Voilá vous êtes!</span>’ he exclaimed. ‘There you
are! <span lang="fr">Je suis le président!</span>’ and he helped himself
to more cake as though by accident.</p>

<p class='c011'>For five seconds Mlle. Fleury kept her face.
Then, in spite of herself, her lips parted and a row
of white teeth appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Meester Reevairs, you spoil them,’ she said, ‘and
I approve it not. <span lang="fr">Mais, voyons donc! Quelles
maniéres!</span>’ she added as Sambo and Pouf passed
from Toby’s lap on to the table and began to sniff
at the water cress.... ‘<span lang="fr">Non, ça c’est <em>trop</em> fort!</span>’
She leaned across to smack them back into propriety.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<span lang="fr">Abominable</span>,’ Paul cried, ‘<span lang="fr">abominable tout à fait</span>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Alwaze when you come such things ’appen.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Pas mon faute,’ he said, helping to catch Pouf.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>‘They are deeficult enough without that you make
them more,’ she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Uncle Paul doesn’t know his genders,’ cried
Jonah; ‘hooray!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Ma faute,’ he corrected himself, pronouncing it
‘fote.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Toby, struggling with Smoke, whose nose
she was trying to force into a saucer of milk which
he did not want, upset the saucer all over her dress
and the table, splashing one and all. Jonah sprang
up and knocked his chair over backwards in the
excitement. Mrs. Tompkyns, wakening from her
sleep upon the piano stool, leaped on to the notes
of the open keyboard with a horrible crash. A
pandemonium reigned, all talking, laughing, shouting
at once, and the governess scolding. Then
Paul trod on a kitten’s tail under the table and
extraordinary shrieks were heard, whereupon Jonah,
stooping to discover their cause, bumped his head
and began to cry. Moving forward to comfort
him, Paul’s sleeve caught in the spout of the tea-pot
and it fell with a clatter among the cups and plates,
sending the sugar-tongs spinning into the air, and
knocking the milk-jug sideways so that a white sea
flooded the whole tray and splashed up with white
spots on to Paul’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cumulative effect of these disasters reached
a culminating point, and a sudden hush fell upon the
room. The children looked a trifle scared. Paul,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>with milk drops trickling down his nose, blushed and
looked solemn. Very guilty and awkward he felt.
Mlle. Fleury in fluent, rattling French explained her
view of the situation, at first, however, without effect.
At such moments mere sound and fury are vain;
subtle, latent influences of the personality alone can
calm a panic, and these the little person did not, of
course, possess.</p>

<p class='c011'>To Paul the whole picture appeared in very vivid
detail. With the simplicity of the child and the
larger vision of the man he perceived how closely
tears and laughter moved before them; and it really
pained him to see her confused and rather helpless
amid all the debris. She was pretty, slim, and graceful;
futile anger did not sit well upon her.</p>

<p class='c011'>There she stood, little more than a girl herself,
staring at him for a moment speechless, the dainty
ruffles of her neat grey dress sticking up about her
pretty throat, he thought, like the bristles of an
enraged kitten. The hair, too, by her ears and
neck suddenly seemed to project untidily and increased
the effect. The sunlight from the window
behind her spread through it, making it cloud-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<span lang="fr">C’est tout mon—ma faute</span>,’ he said, stretching out
both hands impulsively, ‘<span lang="fr">tout!</span>’ in his villainous
Quebec French. ‘Scold <em>me</em> first, please.’</p>

<p class='c011'>There was milk on his left eyebrow, and a crumb
of cake in his beard as well. The governess stared
at him, her eyes still blazing ominously. Her lips
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>quivered. Then, fortunately, she laughed; no one
really could have done otherwise. And that laugh
saved the situation. The children, who had been
standing motionless as statues awaiting their doom,
sprang again into life. In a trice the milk had been
mopped up, the tongs replaced, and the tea-pot put
to bed under its ornamented cosy.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I forgeeve—this time,’ she said. ‘But you are
vairy troublesome.’</p>

<p class='c011'>In future, none the less, she forgave always;
her hostility, never quite sure of itself, vanished
from that moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Blue Summer’ouse,’ whispered Jonah in his ear,
‘and bring your Wind-Vision to read to us at the
Meeting.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But not too much Wind-Vision, please, Meester
Reevairs,’ she said, overhearing the whisper. ‘They
think of nothing else.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul stared at her. The thought in his mind was
that she ought to come too, only he knew the
children would not approve.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then I must moderate their enthusiasm,’ he said
gravely at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mlle. Fleury laughed in his face. ‘<em>You</em> are
worst of ze lot, I know—worst of all. Your
Aventures and plays trouble all their lesson-time.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It is my education,’ he said, as Jonah tugged at
his coat from behind to get him out of the room.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>‘You educate <em>them</em>; they educate <em>me</em>; I improve
slowly. <span lang="fr">Voilá!</span>’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But vairy slowly, <span lang="fr">n’est-ce pas</span>? And you make
up all such <i><span lang="fr">expériences</span></i> like ze Wind-Vision to fill
their minds.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie had told him that all their aventures filtered
through to her, and that she kept a special <em>cahier</em> in
her own room, where she wrote them all out in her
own language. ‘Another soul, perhaps, looking
about for a safety-valve,’ he thought swiftly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But, Mademoiselle, why not translate them into
French? That’s a good idea, and excellent practice
for them.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Per’aps,’ she laughed, ‘per’aps we do that.
<span lang="fr">C’est une idée au moins.</span>’</p>

<p class='c011'>She wanted so much, it was clear, to come into
their happy little world of imagination and adventure.
He realised suddenly how lonely her life might be in
such a household.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You write them, and I will correct them for
you,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Come on, <em>do</em> come on, Uncle,’ cried the voices
urgently from the door. The children were already
in the passage. The little governess looked rather
wistfully after them, and on a sudden impulse Paul
did a thing he had never before done in his life.
He took her hand and kissed the tips of her fingers,
but so boyishly, and with such simple politeness and
sincerity that there was hardly more in the act than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>if Jonah had done the same to Nixie in an aventure
of another sort.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Au revoir then,’ he said laughingly; ‘chacun
a son devoir, don’t they? And now I go to do
mine.’</p>

<p class='c011'>His sentence was somewhat mixed. He just had
time to notice the pretty blush of confusion that
spread over her face, and to hear her laugh ‘You
are weecked children—vairy weecked—and you,
Meester Reevairs, the biggest of all,’ when Nixie
and Jonah had him by the hand and they were off
out of the house to their Meeting in the Blue
Summer-house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus Mlle. Fleury ceased to be a difficulty in
the household so far as his proceedings with the
children were concerned. On the contrary, she
became a helpful force, and often acted as a sort of
sentry, or outpost, between one world and the other.
Herself, she never came into their own private
region, but hovered only along the borders of it.
For though little over twenty years of age, she was
French, and she understood exactly how much
interest she might allow herself to take in the
Society without endangering her own position,—or
theirs—or his. She knew that she could not enter
their world freely and still maintain authority in the
other; but, meanwhile, she managed Paul precisely
as though he were one of her own charges, and saw
to it that he did nothing which could really be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>injurious to the responsibilities for which she was
answerable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus Paul, thundering along with his belated
youth, enjoyed himself more and more, while he
enjoyed, also learned, marked, and read.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It haunted him a good deal, this Vision of the
Winds. Now he never heard the stirring of the
woods without thinking of those delicately brilliant
streamers flying across the sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>The satisfaction of spinning a fairy tale out of it
for the children’s Society was only equalled by the
pleasure of the original inspiration. Here, too, was
a means of expressing himself he had never dreamed
of; the relief was great. Moreover, it brought him
into close touch with the inexhaustible reservoirs
which children draw upon for their endless world of
Make-Believe, and he understood that the child and
the poet live in the same region. His feet were now
set upon that secret path trodden by the feet of
children since the world began; and, for all his
burden of years, there was no telling where it might
lead him. For the springs of perennial youth have
their sources in that region—the youth of the spirit,
with the constant flow of enthusiasm, the touch of
simple, ever-living beauty, and the whole magic of
vision. No one with imagination can ever become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span><i><span lang="fr">blasé</span></i>, perhaps need ever grow old in the true
sense.</p>

<p class='c011'>By this means he might at last turn his accumulated
stores to some useful account. The great geysers of
imagination that dry up too soon with the majority
might keep bubbling for ever; and provided the pipes
kept open for smaller visions, they might with time
become channels for inspiration of a still higher order.
His audience might grow too.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m getting on,’ he observed to Nixie a few days
later; ‘getting on pretty well for an old man!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I knew you would,’ she replied approvingly.
‘Only you wasted a lot of time over it. When you
came you were so old that Toby thought you were
going to die, you know.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So bad as all that, was it?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘H’mmmmm,’ she nodded, her blue eyes faintly
troubled; ‘quite!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul took her on his knee and stared at her. The
world of elemental wonder came quite close. There
was something of magic about the atmosphere of this
child’s presence that made it possible to believe
anything and everything. She embodied exquisitely
so many of his dreams—those dreams of God and
Nature he had lived with all those lonely years in
Canadian solitudes.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You know, <em>I</em> think,’ he said slowly as he
watched with delight the look of tender affection
upon her face, ‘that, without knowing it, you’re
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>something of a little magician, Nixie. What do <em>you</em>
think?’</p>

<p class='c011'>But she only laughed and wriggled on his knee.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Am I really?’ she said presently. ‘Then what
are you, I wonder?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I used to be a Wood Cruiser,’ he replied gravely;
‘but what I am now it’s rather difficult to say. You
ought to know,’ he added, ‘as you’re the magician
who’s changing me.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’ve not changed you,’ she laughed. ‘I only
found you out. The day you came I saw you were
simply full of our things—and that you’d be a sort
of Daddy to us. And we shall want a lot more
Aventures, please, as soon as ever you can write
them out——’</p>

<p class='c011'>She was off his knee and half-way to the house the
same second, for the voice of Mlle. Fleury was heard
in the land. He watched her flitting through the
patches of sunshine across the lawn, and caught the
mischievous glance she turned to throw at him as she
disappeared through the open French window—a
vision of white dress, black legs, and flying hair.
And only when she was gone did his heavier
machinery get to work with the crop of questions he
always thought of too late.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘A beginning, at any rate!’ he said to himself,
thinking of all the things he was going to write for
them. ‘Only I wish we were all in camp out there
among the cedars and hemlocks on Beaver Creek,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>instead of boxed up in this toy garden where there
are no wild animals, and you mayn’t cut down trees
for a big fire, and there are silly little Notice Boards
all over the place about trespassers being prosecuted....’</p>

<p class='c011'>The thought touched something in the centre of
his being. He travelled; laughing and sighing as
he went. ‘My wig!’ he thought aloud, ‘but it’s
really extraordinary how that child brings those big
places over here for me, and makes them seem alive
with all kinds of things <em>I</em> could never have dreamed
of—alone!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Paul, dear, what <em>are</em> you thinking about, here
all by yourself—and without a hat on too, as usual?
If the gardeners hear you talking aloud like this
they will think—! Well, I hardly know quite
what they <em>will</em> think!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Something Blake said—to be honest,’ he laughed,
turning to his sister who had come silently down
the path, dressed, as on the day he had first seen
her, in white serge with a big flower-hat. Languid
she looked, but delicate and wholly charming; she
wore brown garden gauntlets over hands and wrists,
and a red parasol she held aloft, shed a becoming
pink glow upon her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>Maurice</em> Blake!’ she exclaimed. ‘Joan’s cousin
with the big farm on the Downs? But you don’t
know him!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not that Blake,’ he laughed again; ‘and Joan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>if you mean Joan Nicholson, Dick’s niece who took
up that rescue work, or something, in London, I
have never seen in my life.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then it’s a book you mean—one of those books
you are always poring over in the library,’ she
murmured half reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘One of Dick’s books, yes,’ he replied gently,
linking his arm through hers and leading the way
in the direction of the cedars. ‘One of my
“treasures,”’ he added slyly, ‘that you once shamelessly
imagined to be in petticoats.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She rather liked his teasing. The interests they
shared were uncommonly small, perhaps, and the
coinage of available words still smaller. Yet their
differences never took on the slightest ‘edge.’ A
genuine affection smoothed all their little talks.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You do read such funny old books, Paul,’ she
observed, as though somewhere in her heart lurked
a vague desire to make him more modern. ‘Don’t
you ever try books of the day—novels, for instance?’
She had one under her arm at the moment. He
took it to carry for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I have tried,’ he admitted, a little ashamed of
his backwardness, ‘but I never can make out what
they’re driving at—half the time. What they described
has never happened to me, or come into my
world. I don’t recognise it all as true, I mean—’
He stopped abruptly for fear he might say something
to wound her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>‘One can always learn, though, and widen one’s
world, can’t one? After all, we <em>are</em> all in the same
world, aren’t we?’</p>

<p class='c011'>He realised the impossibility of correcting her;
the invitation to be sententious could not catch him;
his nature was too profound to contain the prig.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Are we?’ he said gently.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, I think so—more or less, Paul. There’s
only one <em>nice</em> world, at least.’ She arranged her
hat and parasol to keep the sun off, for she was
afraid of the sun, even the shy sun of England.</p>

<p class='c011'>He pulled out the deck-chair for her, and
opened it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Here,’ she said pointing, ‘if you don’t mind,
dear; or perhaps over <em>there</em> where it looks drier;
or just <em>there</em> under that tree, perhaps, is better still.
It’s more sheltered, and there’s less sun, isn’t there?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I think there is, yes,’ he replied, obeying her.
The phrase ‘there’s less sun’ seemed to him so
neatly descriptive of the mental state of persons
without imagination.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘She’ll come here for her summer holidays soon,’
his sister resumed, going back to Joan. ‘She works
very hard at that “Home” place in town, and
Dick always liked her to use us here as if the place
were her own. I promised that.’ She dropped
gracefully into the wicker chair, and Paul sat down
for a moment beside her on the grass. ‘He spent
a lot of capital, you know, in the thing and made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>her superintendent or something. She has a sort
of passion for this rescuing of slum children, and,
I believe, works herself to death over it, though
she has means of her own. So you will be nice
to her when she comes, won’t you, and look after
her a bit? I do what I can, but I always feel I’m
rather a failure. I never know what to talk to her
about. She’s so dreadfully in earnest about everything.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul promised. Joan sounded rather attractive,
to tell the truth. He remembered something, too,
of the big organisation his old friend had founded
in London for the rescue and education of waif-boys.
A thrill of pride ran through him, and close at its
heels a secret sense of shame, that he himself did
nothing in the great world of action—that his own
life was a mass of selfish dreaming and refined self-seeking,
that all his yearning for God and beauty
was after all, perhaps, but a spiritual egoism. It
was not the first time this thought had come to
trouble and perplex. Of late—especially since he
had begun to find these safety-valves of self-expression,
and so a measure of relief—his mind
had turned in the direction of some bigger field
to work in outside self, perhaps more than he
quite knew or realised.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Paul,’ his sister interrupted his reflections, after
a prolonged fidgeting to make herself comfortable
so that the parasol should shade her, the hat not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>tickle her, and the novel open easily for reading;
‘you are happy here, aren’t you? You’re not
too dull with us, I mean?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s quite delightful, Margaret,’ he answered at
once. ‘In one sense I have never been so happy
in my life.’ He looked straight at her, the sun
catching his brown beard and face. ‘And I love
the children; they’re just the kind of companions
I need.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m so glad, so glad,’ she said genuinely. ‘And
it’s very kind and good-natured of you to be with
them such a lot. You really almost fill Dick’s
place for them.’ She sighed and half closed her
eyes. ‘Some day you may have children of your
own; only you would spoil them quite atrociously,
I’m sure.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Am I spoiling yours?’ he asked solemnly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Dreadfully,’ she laughed; ‘and turning little
Mademoiselle’s head into the bargain.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was his turn to burst out laughing. ‘I think
that young lady can take care of herself without
difficulty,’ he exclaimed; ‘and as for my spoiling
the children, I think it’s they who are spoiling me!’</p>

<p class='c011'>And, presently, with some easy excuse, he left
her side and went off into the woods. Margaret
watched him charge across the lawn. A perplexed
expression came into her face as she picked up her
novel and settled down into the cushions, balancing
the red parasol over her head at a very careful angle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Admiration was in her glance, too, as she saw him
go. Evidently she was proud of her brother—proud
that he was so different from other people, yet
puzzled to the verge of annoyance that he should
be so.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What a strange creature he is,’ was her somewhat
indefinite reflection; ‘I thought but one Dick
could exist in the world! He’s still a boy—not
a day over twenty-five. I wonder if he’s ever been
in love, or ever will be? I think—I hope he won’t;
he’s rather nice as he is after all.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She sighed faintly. Then she dipped again into
her novel, wherein the emotions, from love downwards,
were turned on thick and violent as from
so many taps in a factory; got bored with it;
looked on to the last chapter to see what happened
to everybody; and, finally—fell asleep.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>For the rest of the day Paul was in peculiarly good
spirits; he went about the place full of bedevilment
of all kinds, to the astonishment of the household
in general and of his sister in particular. The
oppressive heat seemed to have no effect upon him.
There was something in the air that excited him, and
he was very busy getting rid of the excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>With bedtime came no desire to sleep. ‘I feel
all worked-up, Margaret,’ he said as he lit her candle
in the hall. ‘I think it must be an “aventure”
coming,’—though, of course, she had no idea what
he meant.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There’s thunder about,’ she replied. ‘It’s been
so very close all day.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Sleep well,’ Paul said when he left her at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>top of the stairs; and the last thing he heard as he
went down the long winding passage to his bedroom
in the west wing was her voice faintly assuring him
‘One always does here, I’m glad to say.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Once inside, and the door shut, he gave himself
up to his mood. It was a mood apparently that
came from nowhere. A soft and mysterious excitement,
all delicious, stirred in the depths of his
being, rising slowly to the surface. Perhaps it
was growing-pains somewhere in the structure of
his personality, engineered subconsciously by his
imagination; perhaps only ‘weather.’ He always
followed the barometer like a strip of dried seaweed.</p>

<p class='c011'>But on this particular night something more than
mere ‘weather’ was abroad; his nerves sent a
succession of swift faint warnings to his brain. To
begin with, the night herself claimed definite attention.
Some nights are just ordinary nights; others
touch the soul and whisper ‘I am the night. Look at
me. Listen!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He obeyed the summons and went to the window,
leaning out as his habit was. The darkness pressed
up in a solid wall, charged to the brim with mysteries
waiting to reveal themselves. No trees were visible,
no outline of moor or hill or garden. The sky was
pinned down to the horizon more tightly than usual—keeping
back all manner of things. Very little
air crept beneath the edges, so that the atmosphere
was oppressive. The day had been cloudless, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>with the sunset whole continents of vapour had
climbed upon the hills of the evening wind, driven
slowly by high currents that had not yet come near
enough the earth to be heard and felt.</p>

<p class='c011'>He coughed—gently. The least noise, he felt,
would shatter some soft and delicate structure that
rose everywhere through the darkness—some web-like
shadow-scaffolding that reared upwards, supporting
the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Something’s going to happen,’ he said low to
himself. ‘I can feel it coming.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He became very imaginative, enjoying his mood
enormously, letting it act as a mental purge.
Aventures that he would discover for the next
Meeting swept through him. The stress and fever
of creative fancy, stirred by the deep travailing of
the elements behind that curtain of night, was upon
him. Then, sleep being far away, he went to the
writing-table, where Nixie’s deft hands had everything
prepared, lit a second candle, and began to
write.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’ll write “How I climbed the Scaffolding of
the Night,”’ he murmured; ‘for I feel it true
within me. I feel as if I were part of the night—part
of all this beautiful soft darkness.’</p>

<p class='c011'>But, before he had written a dozen lines, he
stopped and fell to listening again, staring past the
steady candle-flames out into the open. The stillness
was profound. A single ivy-leaf rattled sharply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>all by itself on the wall outside his window. He
felt as if that leaf tapped faintly upon his own brain.
By a curious process known only to the poetic temperament,
he passed on to <em>feel with</em> everything about
him—as though some portion of himself actually
merged in with the silence, with the perfumes of
trees and garden, with the voice of that little tapping
leaf. And, in proportion as he realised this, he
transferred the magic of it to his tale. He found
the words that fitted his conception like a natural
skin. He knew in some measure the satisfaction
and relief of expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘A year ago—a month ago,’ he thought with
delight, ‘this would have been impossible to me.
Nixie has taught me so much already!’</p>

<p class='c011'>What he really wanted, of course, were the
living, flaming words of poetry. But this he knew
was denied him; perhaps the fire of inspiration did
not burn steadily enough; perhaps the intellectual
foundation was not there. At any rate, he could
only do his best and struggle with the prose, and
this he did with intense pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a time he laid his pen down and fell to
thinking again—the kind of reverie that dramatises
a mood before the inner vision. And another
inspiration came upon him with its sudden little
glory; he realised vividly that <em>within</em> himself a
region existed where all that he desired might find
fulfilment; where yearnings, dreams, desires might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>come true. There existed this inner place within
where he might visualise all he most wished for into
a state of reality. The workshop of the creative
imagination was its vestibule....</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether or not he could put it into words for
others to realise was merely a question of craft....</p>

<p class='c011'>He must have sat thinking in this way much
longer than he knew, for the candles had burnt
down quite low when at length he bestirred himself
with a mighty yawn and rose to go to bed. But
hardly had he begun to unfasten his crumpled black
tie when something made him pause.</p>

<p class='c011'>Far away, through the hush that covered the
world, that ‘something’ was astir—coming swiftly
nearer. He stepped back into the middle of the
room and waited. Smoke, the sleeping black cat
on the sofa, sat up and waited too. Looking about
it with brilliant green eyes, wide open, and whiskers
twitching backwards and forwards, it understood
even better than he did that a change in all that
world of darkness had come to pass. The animal
stared alternately at the window and the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>For another minute the stillness held supreme.
Then, from the silent reaches beyond, this new
sound came suddenly close, dropping down through
leagues of night. It began with a faint roar in the
chimney; a tree outside uttered a soft, rushing cry;
a thousand leaves, instead of one, rattled on the wall.</p>

<p class='c011'>A Messenger, running headlong through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>darkness, was calling aloud a warning as it ran, for
all to understand who could. And, among the few
who were awake and understood, Paul and his four-footed
companion were certainly the first.</p>

<p class='c011'>A sudden movement of the vast fabric of darkness
came next. That scaffolding of shadows
trembled, as though the same moment it would fall
and let in—Light. In front of the bow window the
muslin curtain that so long had hung motionless,
now bellied out slowly into the room. The movement,
mysterious and suggestive, claimed attention
significantly. Paul and Smoke, watching it, exchanged
glances. Then, with a long, sighing sound,
it floated back again to its original position. It hung
down straight and still as before.</p>

<p class='c011'>But in that moment something had entered the
room. Borne by this messenger of the coming
storm, this stray Wind had left its warning—and
was gone!</p>

<p class='c011'>Smoke leapt softly down and padded over to sniff
the curtain, and having done so, blinked up at Paul
with eloquent eyes, and sat back to wait and—wash!
No apparatus of speech ever said more
plainly ‘Look out! Something’s coming! Better
be prepared as I am!’</p>

<p class='c011'>And something did come—almost the same
minute. The forces that had so long been trying to
upset the tent of darkness, did upset it, and from one
uplifted corner there rushed down upon the world a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>blue-white sheet of light that was utterly gorgeous.
For one instant trees, moor, hill leaped into vivid
outline. The hands that held the sheet of brilliance
shook it from the four corners, and all the sky shook
with it; and, immediately after, the scaffolding of
night fell with a prodigious crash, as the true storm,
following upon its herald, descended with a hundred
thunders and the roar of ten hundred trumpets.</p>

<p class='c011'>The true wind rushed headlong into the room
and extinguished both candles. Smoke rubbed
against Paul’s feet in the darkness, thoroughly
aroused; but Paul himself stood still, as the thrill
and splendour of it all entered his heart and filled
him with delight. Thunder, lightning, wind—all
passed mysteriously into his blood till he was almost
conscious of a desire to add the sound of his own
voice and shout aloud. The excitement of the
elemental forces swept into himself. He understood
now the signs of preparation that had been going
forward in him during the day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Splendid sensations, the most splendid he ever
knew, raced to and fro in his being, till it almost
seemed as if his consciousness transferred itself to the
tempest. Surely, that great wind tore out of his
heart, that lightning sprang from his brain, that river
of rain washed, not merely out of the sky, but out
of himself. The edges of his personality became
fluid and melted off into the very nature of the
elements....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>‘Now,’ he exclaimed aloud, pacing to and fro
while Smoke followed him in the darkness and tried
to play with the bows on his pumps, ‘had I but the
means of expression, what a message I could give to
the world, of beauty, splendour, power!’ He
laughed in his excitement. ‘If only the strings of
my poor instrument had been tuned——!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Sighing a little to himself at the thought, he went
to the window. The first fury of the storm had
passed; there was a sudden deep lull broken only by
the rushing drip of rain; he smelt the wet foliage
and soaking grass. Close to the window, it chanced,
there was a dead tree, and in its leafless branches,
outlined sharply by the lightning against the black
sky, he traced what seemed the huge letters of some
elemental alphabet; and at that moment, the returning
wind passed through them like a hand on giant
strings. It drew forth a wonderful sound in response,
a sound that pierced as a two-edged sword to the
centre of his being. It was a true singing wind—a
Wind of Inspiration.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, as he heard it, the great wave that fought
for utterance rose within him and began to force and
tear its way out in spite of everything. Words came
pouring through him—like the stammering of torn
strings upon a fiddle—clipped wings trying to fly—sparks
streaming towards flame yet never achieving
it. Similes and metaphors rushed, mixed and headlong,
through his mind. In a moment he had dashed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>across the floor; the candles were again alight; and
Paul, pencil in hand, was sitting at the table before a
sheet of blank foolscap, the storm crashing about
him, and Smoke watching him calmly with eyes full
of expectant wonder.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then was enacted a little drama—tragedy
if ever there was one—that must often enough take
place in the secret places of the world’s houses, where
the dumb poet seeks to transfer his genuine passion
into the measure of halting and inadequate verse.
Poignantly dramatic the spectacle must be, though
never witnessed mercifully by an audience of more
than one. Paul wrote fast, setting the words down
almost as they came. It was that little passionate
Wind of Inspiration that was the cause of all the
trouble. Smoke jumped up on the table to watch
the motion of the pencil across the paper. For
some reason he hardly thought it worth while to
play with it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Winds of Inspiration blow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet pass me ever by;</div>
      <div class='line'>And songs God taught me long ago,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Unuttered burn and—die.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He read the verse over, and with an impatient motion
altered ‘burn’ into ‘fade.’ Then he shook his head
and continued:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From all the far blue hills of heaven</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The dews of beauty rain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet unto me no drops are given</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To quench the ancient pain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>He scratched out ‘ancient’ and wrote over the
top ‘undying.’ Then he scratched out ‘undying’
and put ‘ancient’ back in its place. This time
Smoke stretched out a long black paw with a velvet
end to it and gave the pencil a deliberate dab. Paul
either ignored, or did not notice it; but Smoke left
the paw thrust forward upon the paper so as to be
ready for the next dab.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I know the passion of the night,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Full of all days unborn,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Full of the yearning of the light</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For one undying Morn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Smoke caught the tip of the pencil with a swift
and accurate stroke, and the ‘M’ of ‘Morn’ was
provided with an irregular tail Paul had not intended.
Very quickly, however, without further interruption,
he wrote on to the end.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>He rose from the table with a gesture of abrupt
impatience and read the entire effusion through from
beginning to end. First he laughed, then he sighed.
He wondered for a moment how it was that so little
of his passion had crept into the poor words. He
crumpled up the paper and tossed it into the drawer;
and then, blowing out the candles, moved over to
the big arm-chair and dropped down into it. Again,
as he sat there, his thoughts fell to dramatising his
mood. He imagined that region within himself
where all might come true, and all yearnings find
adequate expression. The idea got more and more
mingled with the storm. He pictured it to himself
with extraordinarily vivid detail.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There <em>is</em> such a place, such a state,’ he murmured,
‘and it is, it must be accessible.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He heard the clock in the stables—or was it the
church—strike the quarter before midnight.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he sat in the big chair, Smoke left the table
and curled up again on the mat at his feet.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Vision or imagination is a representation of what actually exists,
really and unchangeably. He who does not imagine in stronger and
better lineaments, and in stronger and better light, than his <em>perishing</em>
mortal eye can see, does not imagine at all.—W. B.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Smoke who first drew his attention to something
near the door by ‘padding’ slowly across the
carpet and staring up at the handle. Paul’s eyes,
following him, perceived next that the brass knob
was silently turning. Then the door opened quickly
and on the threshold stood—Nixie. The open door
made such a draught that the twenty winds tearing
about inside the room almost lifted the mat at his
feet. Behind her he saw the shadowy outline of a
second figure, which he recognised as Jonah.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Shut the door—quick!’ he said, but they had
done so and were already beside him almost before
the words were out of his mouth. In spite of the
darkness a very faint radiance came with them so
that he could distinguish their faces plainly; and his
amazement on seeing them at all at this late hour
was instantly doubled when he perceived further that
they were fully dressed for going out. At the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>time, however, so deep had he been in his reverie,
and so strongly did the excitement of it yet linger
in his blood, that he hardly realised how wicked
they were to be parading the house at such a time
of the night, and that his obvious duty was to bundle
them back to bed. In a strange, queer way they
almost seemed part of his dream, part of his
dramatised mood, part of the region of wonder
into which his thoughts had been leading him.
Moreover, he felt in some dim fashion that they
had come with a purpose of great importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s awfully late, you know,’ he exclaimed
under his breath, peering into their faces through
the darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But not too late, if we start at once,’ Jonah
whispered. For a moment Paul had almost thought
that they would melt away and disappear as soon
as he spoke to them, or that they would not answer
at all. But now this settled it; these were no
figures in a dream. He felt their hands upon his
arms and neck; the very perfume of Nixie’s hair
and breath was about him. She was dressed, he
noticed, in her red cloak with the hood over her
head, and her eyes were popping with excitement.
The expression on her face was earnest, almost
grave. He saw the faint gleam of the gold buckle
where the shiny black belt enclosed her little waist.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If we start <em>at once</em>, I said,’ repeated Jonah in
a nervous whisper, pulling at his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Paul started to his feet and began fumbling with
his black tie, feeling vaguely that either he ought
to tie it properly or take it off altogether, and that
it was a sort of indecent tinsel to wear at such a
time. But he only succeeded in pricking his finger
with the pin sticking out of the collar. He felt
more than a little bewildered, if the truth were
told.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’ll do that for you,’ Nixie said under her breath;
and in a twinkling her deft fingers had whipped the
strip of satin from his neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You don’t want a tie where we’re going,’ she
laughed softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Or a hat either,’ added Jonah. ‘But I wish
you’d hurry, please.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’d better put on another coat or a dressing-gown,
or something,’ he stammered.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Coat’s best,’ Jonah told him, and in a moment
he had changed into a tweed Norfolk jacket that
lay upon the chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>They pulled him towards the door, Nixie holding
one hand, Jonah the other, and Smoke following
so closely at his heels that he almost seemed to
be prodding him gently forward with his velvet
padded boots. Paul understood that tremendous
forces, elemental in character like the wind and
rain and lightning, somehow added their immense
suasion to the little hands that pulled his own. He
made no resistance, but just allowed himself to go;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and he went with a wild and boyish delight tearing
through his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Are we going out then?’ he asked, ‘out of
doors?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What’s the exact time, the <em>very</em> exact time?’
Nixie asked hurriedly, ignoring his question; and
though Paul had looked a few minutes before they
came in, he had quite forgotten by now. She helped
herself to his watch, burrowing under his coat to
find it, and peering closely to read the position of
the hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Five minutes to twelve!’ she exclaimed, addressing
Jonah in excited whispers. ‘Oh, I say! We
must be off at once, or we shall miss the crack
altogether. Come on, Uncle, or your life won’t
be safe a minute.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then what will it be a month, I should like
to know?’ he laughed as he was swept along through
the darkness, not knowing what to say or think.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The crack! The crack! Quick, or we shall
miss it!’ cried the children in the same sentence,
urging him heavily forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What crack? Where are we going to? What
does it all mean?’ he asked breathlessly, trying to
avoid treading on their toes and the toes of Smoke
who flew beside them with tail held swiftly aloft
as though to guide them.</p>

<p class='c011'>They brought him up with a sudden bump just
outside the door, and Nixie turned up a serious face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>to explain, while Jonah waited impatiently in front
of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Quick!’ she whispered, ‘listen and I’ll tell you.
We’re going to find the crack between Yesterday
and To-morrow, and then—slip through it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>His heart leaped with excitement as he heard.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Go on,’ he cried. ‘Tell me more!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You see, Yesterday really begins just after Midnight
when To-day ends’; she said, ‘and To-morrow
begins there too.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘After Midnight, To-morrow jumps away again
a whole day, and is as far off as ever. That’s the
nearest you can get to To-morrow.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I see.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And Yesterday, which has been a whole day
away, suddenly jumps up close behind again. So
that Yesterday and To-morrow,’ she went on, eager
with excitement, ‘meet at Midnight for a single
second before flying off to their new places. Daddy
told us that long ago.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Exactly. They must.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But now the world is old and worn. There’s a
tiny little crack between Yesterday and To-morrow.
They don’t join as they once did, and, if we’re <em>very</em>
quick, we can find the crack and slip through——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Bless my Timber Limits!’ he exclaimed; ‘what
a glorious notion!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And, once inside there, there’s no time, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>course,’ she went on, more and more hurriedly.
‘<em>Anything</em> may happen, and <em>everything</em> come true.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The very region I was thinking about just
now!’ thought Paul. ‘The very place! I’ve found
it!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>Do</em> hurry up, oh <em>do</em>!’ put in Jonah with a
loud whisper that echoed down the corridor, for his
patience was at length exhausted by all this explanation.
‘You <em>are</em> so slow getting started.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Ready!’ cried Paul and Nixie in the same
breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were off! Down the dark and silent stairs
on tiptoe, through the empty halls, past the hat-racks
and the stuffed deer heads that grinned down upon
them from the walls, along the stone passage to the
kitchen region, where the row of red fire-buckets
gleamed upon the shelves, and so, past the ghostly
pantry, to the back door. This they found open,
for Jonah had already run ahead and unlocked it.
Another minute and they had crossed the yard by
the stables, where the pump stood watching them like
a figure with an outstretched arm, and soon were
well out on to the lawn at the back of the house. The
rain had ceased, but the wind caught them here with
such tremendous blows and shouting that they could
hardly hear themselves speak, and had to keep closely
together in a bunch to make their way at all. It was
pitch dark and the stars were hidden. Paul stumbled
and floundered, treading incessantly on the toes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the more nimble children. Smoke ran like a black
shadow, now in front, now behind.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We’re nearly there,’ Nixie cried encouragingly,
as he made a false step and landed with a crash in
the middle of some low laurel bushes. ‘But <em>do</em> be
more careful, Uncle, please,’ she added, helping him
out again.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There’s the clock striking!’ Jonah called, a
little in front of them. ‘We’re only just in time!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul recovered himself and pulled up beside them
under the shadows of the big twin cedars that stood
like immense sentries at the end of the lawn. He
came rolling in, swaying like a ship in a heavy sea.
And, as he did so, the sound of a church bell striking
the hour came to their ears through the terrific uproar
of the elements, blown this way and that by the
wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was midnight striking.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the same instant he heard a peculiar sharp
sound like whistling—the noise wind makes tearing
through a narrow opening.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The crack, the crack!’ cried his guides together.
‘That’s the air rushing. It’s coming. Look out!’
They seized him by the hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But I shall never get through,’ shouted Paul,
thinking of his size for the first time.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes you will,’ Nixie screamed back at him above
the roar. ‘Between the sixth and seventh strokes,
remember.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>The fifth stroke had already sounded. The wind
caught it and went shrieking into the sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>Six! boomed the distant bell through the night.
They held his hands in a vice.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a sound like an express train tearing
through the air. A quick flash of brilliance followed,
and a long slit seemed to open suddenly in the
sky before them, and then flash past like lightning.
Nixie tugged at one hand, and Jonah tugged
at the other. Smoke scampered madly past his
feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>A wild rush of wind swept him along, whistling
in his ears; there was a breathless and giddy sensation
of dropping through empty space that seemed as
though it could never end—and then Paul suddenly
found himself sitting on a grassy bank beside a river,
Nixie and Jonah on either side of him, and Smoke
washing his face in front of them as though nothing
in the whole world had ever happened to disturb his
equanimity. And a bright, soft light, like the light
of the sun, shone warmly over everything.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Only just managed it,’ Nixie observed to Jonah.
‘He <em>is</em> rather wide, isn’t he?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Everybody’s thin somewhere,’ was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And the crack is very stretchy’—she added,—‘luckily.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul drew a long breath and stretched himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Well,’ he said, still a little breathless and dizzy,
‘such things were never done in my day.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>‘But this isn’t your day any more,’ explained
Nixie, her blue eyes popping with laughter and
mischief, ‘it’s your night. And, anyhow, as I told
you, there’s no time here at all. There’s no hurry
now.’</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The imagination is not a state; it is the human existence itself.—W. B.</p>

<p class='c010'>Paul, looking round, felt utterly at peace with himself
and the world; at rest, he felt. That was his
first sensation in the mass. He recovered in a
moment from his breathless entrance, and a subtle
pleasure began to steal through his veins. It seemed
as if every yearning he had ever known was being
ministered to by competent unseen Presences; and,
obviously, the children and the cats—Mrs. Tompkyns
had somehow managed to join Smoke—felt likewise,
for their countenances beamed and blinked supreme
contentment.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Ah!’ observed Jonah, sitting contentedly on the
grass beside him. ‘This is the place.’ He heaved
a happy little sigh, as though the statement were
incontrovertible.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It is,’ echoed Paul. And Nixie’s eyes shone like
blue flowers in a field of spring.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The crack’s smaller than it used to be though,’
he heard her murmuring to herself. ‘Every year
it’s harder to get through. I suppose something’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>happening to the world—or to people; some change
going on——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Or we’re getting older,’ Jonah put in with profounder
wisdom than he knew.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul congratulated himself upon his successful
entrance. He felt something of a dog! The bank
on which he lay sloped down towards a river fledged
with reeds and flowers; its waters, blue as the sky,
flowed rippling by, and a soft wind, warm and
scented, sighed over it from the heart of the summer.
On the opposite shore, not fifty yards across, a grove
of larches swayed their slender branches lazily in the
sun, and a little farther down the banks he saw a
line of willows drooping down to moisten their
tongue-like leaves. The air hummed pleasantly with
insects; birds flashed to and fro, singing as they
flew; and, in the distance, across miles of blue
meadowlands, hills rose in shadowy outline to the
sky. He feasted on the beauty of it all, absorbing
it through every sense.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But where are we?’ he asked at length, ‘because
a moment ago we were in a storm somewhere?’
He turned to Nixie who still lay talking to herself
contentedly at his side. ‘And what really happens
here?’ he added with a blush. ‘I feel so extraordinarily
happy.’</p>

<p class='c011'>They lay half-buried among the sweet-scented
grasses. Jonah burrowed along the shore at some
game of his own close by, and the cats made a busy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>pretence of hunting wild game in a dozen places at
once, and then suddenly basking in the sun and
washing each other’s necks and backs as though
wild-game hunting were a bore.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nothing ’xactly—<em>happens</em>,’ she answered, and
her voice sounded curiously like wind in rushes—‘but
everything—<em>is</em>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed to him as though he listened to some
spirit of the ages, very wise with the wisdom of
eternal youth, that spoke to him through the pretty
little mouth of this rosy-faced child.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s like that river,’ she went on, pointing to the
blue streak winding far away in a ribbon through
the landscape, ‘which flows on for ever in a circle,
and never comes to an end. Everything here goes
on always, and then always begins again.’</p>

<p class='c011'>For the river, as Paul afterwards found out, ran
on for miles and miles, in the curves of an immense
circle, of which the sea itself was apparently nothing
but a widening of certain portions.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So here,’ continued the child, making a pattern
with daisies on his sleeve as she talked, ‘you can go
over anything you like again and again, and it need
never come to an end at all. Only,’ she added,
looking up gravely into his face, ‘you must really,
<em>really</em> want it to start with.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Without getting tired?’ he asked, wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course; because <em>you</em> begin over and over
again with it.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>‘Delightful!’ he exclaimed, ‘that means a place
of eternal youth, where emotions continually renew
themselves.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s the place where you find lost things,’
she explained, with a little puzzled laugh at his
foolish long words, ‘and where things that came to
no proper sort of end—things that didn’t come true,
I mean, in the world, all happen and enjoy themselves——’</p>

<p class='c011'>He sat up with a jerk, forgetting the carefully
arranged daisies on his coat, and scattering them all
over the grass.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But this is too splendid!’ he cried. ‘This is
what I’ve always been looking for. It’s what I was
thinking about just now when I tried to write a
poem and couldn’t.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>We</em> found it long ago,’ said the child, pointing
to Jonah and Mrs. Tompkyns, Smoke having
mysteriously disappeared for the moment. ‘We
live here really most of the time. Daddy brought
us here first.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Things life promised, but never gave, here come
to full fruition,’ Paul murmured to himself. ‘You
mean,’ he added aloud, ‘this is where ideals that
have gone astray among the years may be found
again, and actually realised? A kingdom of heaven
within the heart?’ He was very excited, and forgot
for the moment he was speaking to a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I don’t know about all that,’ she answered, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>a puzzled look. ‘But it is life. We live-happily-ever-after
here. That’s what I mean.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It all comes true here?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘All, all, all. All broken things and all lost
things come here and are happy again,’ she went on
eagerly; ‘and if you look hard enough you can find
’xactly what you want and ’xactly what you lost.
And once you’ve found it, nothing can break it or
lose it again.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul stared, understanding that the voice speaking
through her was greater than she knew.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And some things are lost, <em>we</em> think,’ she added,
‘simply because they were wanted—wanted very much
indeed, but never got.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yet these are certainly the words of a child,’ he
reflected, wonder and delight equally mingled, ‘and of
a child tumbling about among great spiritual things
in a simple, intuitive fashion without knowing it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘All the things that ought to happen, but never
do happen,’ she went on, picking up the scattered
daisies and making the pattern anew on a different
part of his coat. ‘They all are found here.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Wishes, dreams, ideals?’ he asked, more to see
what answer she would make than because he didn’t
understand.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I suppose that’s the same thing,’ she replied.
‘But, now <em>please</em>, Uncle Paul, keep still a minute or
I can’t possibly finish this crown the daisies want me
to make for them.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Paul stared into her eyes and saw through them
to the blue of the sky and the blue of the winding
river beyond; through to the hills on the horizon,
a deeper blue still; and thence into the softer blue
shadows that lay over the timeless land buried in
the distances of his own heart, where things might
indeed come true beyond all reach of misadventure
or decay. For this, of course, was the real land of
wonder and imagination, where everything might
happen and nothing need grow old. The vision of
the poet saw&#160;... far—far....</p>

<p class='c011'>All this he realised through the blue eyes of the
child at his side, who was playing with daisies and
talking about the make-believe of children. His
being swam out into the sunshine of great distances,
of endless possibilities, all of which he might be able
afterwards to interpret to others who did not see so
far, or so clearly, as himself. He began to realise
that his spirit, like the endless river at his feet, was
without end or beginning. Thrills of new life
poured into him from all sides.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And when we go back,’ he heard the musical
little voice saying beside him, ‘that church will be
striking exactly where we left it—the sixth stroke,
I mean.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course; <em>I</em> see!’ cried Paul, beginning to
realise the full value of his discovery, ‘for there’s
no time here, is there? Nothing grows old.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s it,’ she laughed, clapping her hands, ‘and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>you can find all the lost and broken things you want,
if you look hard and—really want them.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I want a lot,’ he mused, still staring into the
little wells of blue opposite; ‘the kind that are lost
because they’ve never been “got,”’ he added with
a smile, using her own word.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘For instance,’ Nixie continued, hanging the
daisies now in a string from his beard, ‘all my
broken things come here and live happily—if I
broke them by accident; but if I broke them in a
temper, they are still angry and frighten me, and
sometimes even chase me out again. Only Jonah
has more of these than I have, and they are all on
the other side of the river, so we’re quite safe here.
Now watch,’ she added in a lower voice, ‘Look
hard under the trees and you’ll see what I mean
perhaps. And wish hard, too.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul’s eyes followed the direction of her finger
across the river, and almost at once dim shapes
began to move to and fro among the larches, starting
into life where the shadows were deepest. At first
he could distinguish no very definite forms, but
gradually the outlines grew clearer as the forms
approached the edges of the wood, coming out into
the sunshine.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The ghosts! The ghosts of broken things!’
cried Jonah, running up the bank for protection.
‘Look! They’re coming out. Some one’s thinking
about them, you see!’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Paul, as he gazed, thought he had never seen
such an odd collection of shapes in his life. They
stalked about awkwardly like huge insects with legs
of unequal length, and with a lop-sided motion that
made it impossible to tell in which direction they
meant to go. They had brilliant little eyes that
flashed this way and that, making a delicate network
of rays all through the wood like the shafts of a
hundred miniature search-lights. Their legs, too,
were able to bend both forwards and backwards
and even sideways, so that when they appeared to
be coming towards him they really were going away;
and the strange tumbling motion of their bodies,
due to the unequal legs, gave them an appearance
that was weirdly grotesque rather than terrifying.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was, indeed, a curious and delightful assortment
of goblins. There were dolls without heads,
and heads without dolls; milk jugs without handles,
china teapots without spouts, and spouts without
china teapots; clocks without hands, or with cracked
and wounded faces; bottles without necks; broken
cups, mugs, plates, and dishes, all with gaping
slits and cracks in their anatomy, with half their
faces missing, or without heads at all; every sort
of vase imaginable with every sort of handle unimaginable;
tin soldiers without swords or helmets,
china puppies without tails, broken cages, knives
without handles; and a collection of basins of all
sizes that would have been sufficient to equip an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>entire fleet of cross-channel steamers: altogether a
formidable and pathetic army of broken creatures.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What in the world are they trying to do?’ he
asked, after watching their antics for some minutes
with amazement.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Looking for the broken parts,’ explained Jonah,
who was half amused, half alarmed. ‘They get out
of shape like that because they pick up the first
pieces they find.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And <em>you</em> broke all these things?’</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy nodded his head proudly. ‘I reckernise
most of them,’ he said, ‘but they’re nearly all
accidents. I said “sorry” for each one.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That, you see,’ Nixie interrupted, ‘makes all
the difference. If you break a thing on purpose in
a temper, you murder it; but the accidents come
down here and feel nothing. They hardly know
who broke them. In the end they all find their
pieces. It’s the heaven of broken things, we call
it. But now let’s send them away.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘How?’ asked Paul.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘By forgetting them,’ cried Jonah.</p>

<p class='c011'>They turned their faces away and began to think
of other things, and at once the figures began to
fade and grow dim. The lights went out one by
one. The grotesque shapes melted into the trees,
and a minute later there was nothing to be seen but
the slender larch stems and the play of sunlight and
shadow beneath their branches.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>‘You see how it works, at any rate,’ Nixie said.
‘Anything you’ve lost or broken will come back
if you think hard enough—nice things as well as
nasty things—but they must be real, real things, and
you must want them in a real, real way.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was, indeed, he saw, the region where thoughts
come true.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then do broken people come here too?’ Paul
asked gravely after a considerable pause, during
which his thoughts went profoundly wandering.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes; only we don’t happen to know any. But
all our dead animals are here, all the kittens that
had to be drowned, and the puppies that died, and
the collie the Burdons’ motor killed, and Birthday,
our old horse that had to be shot. They’re all here,
and all happy.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Let’s go and see them then,’ he cried, delighted
with this idea of a heaven of broken animals.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a moment they were on their feet and away
over the springy turf, singing and laughing in the
sunshine, picking flowers, jumping the little brooks
that ran like crystal ribbons among the grass, Nixie
and Jonah dancing by his side as though they had
springs in their feet and wings on their shoulders.
More and more the country spread before them like
a great garden run wild, and Paul thought he had
never seen such fields of flowers or smelt such
perfumes in the wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What’s the matter now?’ he exclaimed, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Jonah stopped and began to stare hard at an acre
of lilies of the valley by the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘He’s calling some things of his own,’ Nixie
answered. ‘Stare and think—and they’ll all come.
But we needn’t bother about him. Come along!’
And he only had time to see the lilies open in an
avenue to make way for a variety of furry, four-legged
creatures, when the child pulled him by the
hand and they were off again at full speed across
the fields.</p>

<p class='c011'>A sound of neighing made him turn round, and
before he could move aside, a large grey horse with
a flowing tail and a face full of gentle beneficence
came trotting over the turf and stopped just behind
him, nuzzling softly into his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nice, silly-faced old thing,’ said Nixie, running
up to speak to it, while a brown collie trotted quietly
at her heels. A little further off, peeping up through
a tangled growth of pinks and meadow-sweet, he saw
the faces of innumerable kittens, watching him with
large and inquisitive eyes, their ears just topping
the flowers like leaves of fur. Such a family of
animals Paul thought he had never even dreamed of.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This is the heaven of the lost animals,’ Nixie
cried from her seat on the back of the grey horse,
having climbed up by means of a big stone. On
her shoulder perched a small brown owl, blinking
in the light like the instantaneous shutter of a
photographic camera. It had fluffy feathers down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>to its ankles like trousers, and was very tame.
‘And they are always happy here and have plenty
to eat and drink. They play with us far better here
than outside, and are never frightened. Of course,
too, they get no older.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul climbed up behind her on the horse’s
back.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Now we’re off!’ he cried; and with Jonah and
a dozen animals at their heels, they raced off across
the open country, holding on as best they could
to mane and tail, laughing, shouting, singing, while
the wind whistled in their ears and the hot sun
poured down upon their bare heads.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, suddenly, the horse stopped with a jerk
that sent them sprawling forward upon his neck.
He turned his head round to look at them with a
comical expression in his big, brown eyes. Paul slid
off behind, and Nixie saved herself by springing sideways
into a bed of forget-me-nots. The owl fluttered
away, blinking its eyes more rapidly than ever in a
kind of surprised fury, shaking out its fluffy trousers,
and Jonah arrived panting with his dogs and rabbits
and puppies.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Come,’ exclaimed Nixie breathlessly, ‘he’s had
enough by now. No animal wants people too long.
Let’s get something to eat.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And I’ll cook it,’ cried the boy, busying himself
with sticks and twigs upon the ground. ‘We’ll
have stodgy-pudding and cake and jam and oyster-patties,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>and then more stodgy-pudding again to
finish up with.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul glanced round him and saw that all the
animals had disappeared—gone like thoughts forgotten.
In their place he soon saw a column of blue
smoke rising up among the fir trees close behind him,
and the children flitting to and fro through it
looking like miniature gypsies. The odour of the
burning wood was incense in his nostrils.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But can’t I see something too—something of my
own?’ he asked in an aggrieved tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie and Jonah looked up at him with surprise.
‘Of course you can,’ they exclaimed together. ‘Just
stare into space as the cats do, and think, and wish,
and wait. Anything you want will come—with
practice. People you’ve lost, or people you’ve
wanted to find, or anything that’s never come true
anywhere else.’</p>

<p class='c011'>They went on busily with their cooking again,
and Paul, lying on his back in the grass some distance
away, sent his thoughts roaming, searching, deeply
calling, far into the region of unsatisfied dreams and
desires within his heart....</p>

<p class='c011'>For what seemed hours and hours they wandered
together through the byways of this vast, enchanted
garden, finding everything they wished to find, forgetting
everything they wished to forget, amusing
themselves to their heart’s content; till, at last, they
stood together on a big boulder in the river where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the spray rose about them in a cloud and painted a
rainbow above their heads.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Get ready! Quick!’ cried Jonah. ‘The
Crack’s coming!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s coming!’ repeated Nixie, seizing Paul’s
hand and urging him to hold very tight.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had no time to reply. There was a rushing
sound of air tearing through a narrow opening.
The sky grew dark, with a roaring in his ears and
a sense of great things flying past him. Again
came the sensation of dropping giddily through
space, and the next minute he found himself standing
with the two children upon the lawn, darkness
about them, and the storm howling and crashing over
their heads through the branches of the twin cedars.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There’s the clock still striking,’ Nixie cried.
‘It’s only been a few seconds altogether.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He heard the church clock strike the last six
strokes of midnight.</p>

<p class='c010'>For some minutes he realised little more than
that he felt rather stiff and uncomfortable in his
bedroom chair, and that he was chilly about the
legs. Outside the wind still roared and whistled,
making the windows rattle, while gusts of rain fell
volleying against the panes as though trying to get
in. A roll of distant thunder came faintly to his
ear. He stretched himself and began to undress by
the light of a single candle.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>On the table lay a sheet of paper headed ‘How
I climbed the Scaffolding of the Night,’ and he read
down the page and then took his pen and wrote the
heading of something else on another sheet:
‘Adventure in the Land between Yesterday and
To-morrow.’ With a mighty yawn he then blew out
his candle and tumbled into bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>And with him, for all the howling of the elements,
came a strange sense of peace and happiness. Out
of the depths rose gradually before his inner eye
in a series of delightful pictures the scenes he had
just left, and he understood that the pathway to
that country of dreams fulfilled and emotions that
never die, lay buried far within his own being.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Between Yesterday and To-morrow’ was to be
the children’s counterpart of that timeless, deathless
region where the spirit may always go when hunted
by the world, fretted by the passion of unsatisfied
yearnings, plagued by the remorseless tribes of sorrow
and disaster. There none could follow him, just
as none—none but himself—could bring about its
destruction. For he had found the mystical haven
where all lost or broken things eternally reconstruct
themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ‘Crack,’ of course, may be found by all who
have the genuine yearning to recreate their world
more sweetly, provided they possess at the start
enough imagination to repay the trouble of training—also
that <em>Wanderlust</em> of the spirit which seeks ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>for a resting-place in the great beyond that reaches
up to God.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul as yet had but discovered the entrance, led
by little children who dreamed not how wondrous
was the journey; but the rest would follow. For
it is a region mapped gradually out of a thousand
impulses, out of ten thousand dreams, out of the
eternal desires of the soul. It is not discovered in
a day, nor do the ways of entrance always remain
the same. A thousand joys contribute to its
fashioning, a thousand frustrated hopes describe its
boundaries, and ten thousand griefs bring slowly,
piece by piece, the material for its construction,
while every new experience of the soul, successful
or disastrous, adds something to its uncharted
geography. Slowly it gathers into existence, becoming
with every sojourn more real and more satisfying,
till at length from the pain of all possible disillusionment
the way opens to the heart of relief, to the
peaceful place of hopes renewed, of purposes made
fruitful and complete.</p>

<p class='c011'>And from this deathless region, too, flow all the
forces of the soul that make for hope, enthusiasm,
courage, and delight. The children might call it
‘Between Yesterday and To-morrow,’ and find their
little broken dreams brought back to life; but Paul
understood that its rewards might vary immensely
according to the courage and the need of the soul
that sought it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Thus, led delicately by the animals and the children,
and guided to a certain extent, too, by the curious
poesy of his own soul, Paul Rivers came gradually
into his own. Once made free of their world, he
would learn next that the process automatically
made him free of his own. This simple expedient
of having found an audience did wonders for him,
for it not only loosened his tongue and his pen, but
set all the deeper parts of him running into speech,
and the natural love and poetry of the man began
to produce a delightful, if somewhat extraordinary,
harvest.</p>

<p class='c011'>He understood—none better—that fantasy, unless
rooted in reality, leads away from action and tends
to weakness and insipidity; but that, grounded in
the common facts of life, and content with idealising
the actual, it might become an important factor for
good, lending wings to the feet and lifting the soul
over difficult places. His education advanced by
leaps and bounds.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>And in some respects he showed himself possessed
of a wisdom that could only have belonged to him
because at heart he was still a child, and the ordinary
‘knowledge of the world’ had not come to spoil him
in his life of solitude among the trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>For instance, that ‘Between Yesterday and To-morrow’
bore some curious relation to reverie and
dreams, he dimly discerned, yet, with this simple
and profound wisdom of his, he refused to pry too
closely into the nature of such relationship. He did
not seek to reduce the delightful experience to the
little hard pellet of an exact fact. For that, he felt,
would be to lose it. Exact knowledge, he knew,
was often merely a great treachery, and ‘fact’ a
dangerous weapon that deceived, and might even
destroy, its owner. If he analysed too carefully, he
might analyse the whole thing out of existence
altogether, and such a contingency was not to be
thought of for a single moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, the attitude of the children confirmed
his own. They never referred to their adventures
until he had given them form and substance in his
reports as recording secretary of the society. No
word passed their lips until they had heard them
read out, and <em>then</em> they talked of nothing else.
During the day they maintained a sublime ignorance
of his ‘aventures of the night,’ as though nothing
of the kind had ever happened; and this tended still
further to relegate it all to a region untouched by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>time, beyond the reach of chance, beyond the destruction
of mere talk, eternal and real in the great
sense.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, as this hidden country he had discovered
yielded to exploration, becoming more and
more mapped out, and its springs of water tapped,
Paul was conscious that the power from these vital
sources began to modify his character, and to enlarge
his outlook upon life. Imagination, released and
singing, provides the greatest of all magics—belief
in one’s self. The rivers of feeling carve their own
channels, which are ever the shortest way to the
ocean of fulfilment. The effects spread gradually to
the remotest corner of his being.</p>

<p class='c011'>One rainy day he found himself alone in the
schoolroom with Nixie, for it was Saturday afternoon,
and Mlle. Fleury had carried off Jonah and Toby in
their best clothes, and to their acute dismay, to have
tea with the children—they were dull children—at
the vicarage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dressed in blue serge, with a broad white collar
over her shoulders and a band of gold about her
waist that matched the colour of her hair, she darted
about the room with her usual effect of brightness,
so that he found himself continually thinking the
sun had burst through the clouds. She was busily
arranging cats and kittens in various positions in
which they showed no inclination to remain, till the
performance had somewhat the air of the old-fashioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>game of ‘general post.’ Paul sat lazily at the ink-stained
table, dividing his attentions between watching
the child’s fascinating movements and pecking
idly into the soft wood with his little gold penknife.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Aren’t you <em>very</em> glad we found you out so soon,
Uncle Paul?’ she asked suddenly, looking up at
him over a back of glossy and wriggling yellow fur.
‘Aren’t you very glad <em>indeed</em>, I mean?’</p>

<p class='c011'>He went on picking at the soft ditches between
the ridges of dirty brown without answering for a
moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes,’ he said presently, in the slow manner of a
man who weighs his words; ‘very glad indeed. It’s
increased my interest in life. It’s made me happier,
and healthier, and wealthier, and all the rest of it—and
wiser too.’ He bent, frowning, over the
ditches.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It was all your own fault, you know, that we
didn’t get you sooner. Oh, years ago—ever so
many.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But I was in the backwoods, Nixie.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That made no difference,’ she answered
promptly. ‘If you had written to us, as mother
often asked, we should have noticed at once what
you were.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘How could that possibly be?’ he objected,
still without looking up.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course!’ was the overwhelming reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, come now,’ he said, staring at her solemnly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>over the table; ‘I admit your penetration is pretty
keen, but I doubt <em>that</em>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She returned his gaze with an expression of grave,
almost contemptuous surprise, tossing her hair back
impatiently with a jerk from her face. She had
finally established the kittens, Zezette and Sambo, in
a sleepy heap just where she wanted them on the top
of the squirrel’s cage.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But, Uncle,’ she exclaimed, ‘between yesserdayantomorrow
you can meet people even after
they’ve gone altogether. So America wouldn’t have
been difficult. How can you think such things?’</p>

<p class='c011'>Not knowing exactly how it was he could think
such things, Paul made no immediate reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Anyhow,’ she resumed, ‘it didn’t take long
once you were here. We saw in a second in the
drawinroom what you were—the day you
arrived.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But I acted so well! I’m sure now I behaved—’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You behaved just like Jonah,’ she interrupted
him with swift decision, ‘—only bigger!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul laughed to himself. His inquisitor shot
across the room to establish Pouf, another kitten, on
the piano top. She moved lightly, with a dancing
motion that flung her hair behind her through the
air, again producing the effect of a sunlight gleam.
Paul continued to destroy the table with his blunt
penknife, chuckling inwardly at the figure he must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>have cut that summer afternoon in the ‘drawinroom’
before these mercilessly observant eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You stood about shyly just like him and Toby—in
lumps,’ she went on presently, ‘saying things
in a sudden, jerky way—’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In lumps!’ cried Paul. ‘That’s a nice way to
talk to your Uncle!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie burst out laughing. ‘Oh, I don’t mean
that quite,’ she explained; ‘but you stood about as if
you found it hard to balance, and were afraid to
move off the mat. Just as Jonah does at a party
when he’s shy. I copied you <em>exactly</em> when I got
upstairs.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Did I indeed? Did you indeed, I mean?’ said
he, wondering whether he ought to feel offended
or pleased at the picture.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes, rather,’ declared the child emphatically,
darting up with Pouf who had definitely rejected the
top of the piano, and planting it on the table under
his nose, where it immediately sat down, purring
loudly and staring into his face. ‘I should think
you did! You see, Pouf says so too; he’s purring
his agreement. Listen to him! That’s fur
language.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He listened as he was bid, gazing first into the
green eyes of the kitten that opened so wide they
seemed to have no lids at all, and then into the
mischievous blue eyes of his other tormentor. He
decided that on the whole he felt pleased.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>‘Then I wasted a lot of time,’ he observed
presently, ‘about joining, I mean—coming into your
world.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘H’mmmm, you did.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Only, remember, you were all very young when
I was in America, weren’t you?’ he added by way
of excuse.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie nodded her head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And you, I expect,’ she replied thoughtfully,
‘were too hard then. I hadn’t thought of that.
You might never have squeezed through the Crack,
mightn’t you? You’re much softer now,’ she
decided after a second’s reflection, ‘ever so much
softer!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I <em>have</em> improved, I think,’ he admitted, blushing
like a pleased schoolboy. ‘I am decidedly softer!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He made a violent dig with his penknife, breaking
down the hard barrier between two ditches, whereupon
Pouf, thinking the resultant splinter was a
plaything specially contrived for its happiness, opened
its eyes wider than ever, and stretched out a paw
that looked huge compared with the splinter and
the penknife. Paul put the weapon away, and Pouf
fixed its eyes intently on the pocket where it had
vanished, leaving its paw absent-mindedly lying on
the splinter which it had already wholly forgotten.
It purred louder than ever, trying to give the impression
that it was really a big cat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside the rain fell softly. A blue-bottle buzzed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>noisily about the room, banging the ceiling and the
walls as though it were exceedingly angry. Through
the open window floated the smell of the English
garden soaked in rain, odours of soused trees and
lawns, and wet air—exquisitely fragrant.</p>

<p class='c011'>A hush fell over the room; only the purring of
the kittens broke it. Paul thought it was the most
soothing sound in the whole world; something
began to purr within himself. His head, and
Nixie’s head, and little Pouf’s head—all lay very
close together over that schoolroom table, each full
of its own busy dreams. These queer, gentle talks
with the child were very delightful to him, all his
shyness and self-consciousness gone, and the spirit
of true wonder, simple and profound, awake in his
heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>Together, for a long time, they listened in silence
to these sounds of purring and breathing and the
murmur of rain falling outside: deep, velvety
breathing it was, almost inaudible. Everything in
life, Paul caught himself reflecting, tragedy or
comedy, goes on against a background of this deep,
hidden, purring sound of life. Breathing is the first
manifestation of life; it is the music of the world,
the soft, continuous hum of existence. His thoughts
travelled far....</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes, on the whole,’ he muttered at length inconsequently,
‘I think I may consider myself softer
than before—kinder, gentler, more alive!’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>But neither Nixie, nor Pouf, nor, for that matter,
Sambo and Zezette either, paid the smallest attention
to his remark; he was soon lost again in further
reflections.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the child’s voice that presently recalled him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Uncle Paul,’ she said very softly, her mind still
busy with thoughts of her own, ‘do you know that
sometimes I have heard the earth breathing too—akchilly
breathing?’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul, coming back from a long journey, turned
and gazed at the eager little face beside him in
silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The earth is alive, I’m sure,’ she went on with
an air of great mystery. ‘It breathes and whispers,
and even purrs; sometimes it cries. It’s a great
body, alive—just like you and the other stars——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nixie!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They are all bodies, though; heavenly bodies,
Daddy called them. Only we, I suppose, are too
small to see it that way perhaps.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul listened, stroking Pouf slowly. The child’s
voice was low and somewhat breathless with the
excitement of what she was saying. She believed
every word of it intensely. Only a very small part
of what she was thinking found expression in her
words. Her ideas beckoned her beyond; and mere
words could not overtake them at her age.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The earth,’ she went on, seeing that he did not
laugh, ‘is somebody’s big round body rolling down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>the sky. It simply must be. Daddy always said
that a fly settling on our bodies didn’t know we were,
alive, so we can’t understand that the earth is alive
either. Only <em>I know it</em>. Oh!’ she cried out with
sudden enthusiasm, ‘how I would love to hear its
real out-loud voice. What a t’riffic roar it must be.
I only wish my ears were further——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Sharper, you mean.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But, all the same, I <em>have</em> heard it breathing,’
she added more quietly, lifting Pouf suddenly and
wrapping its sleeping body round her neck like a
boa, ‘just like this.’ She put her head on one side,
so that her cheek was against the kitten’s lips, and
the faint stream of its breathing tickled her ear.
‘Only the breathing of the earth is much, ever so
much, longer and deeper. It’s whole months long.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul was listening now with his undivided attention.
He was being admitted to the very heart of
an imaginative child’s world, and the knowledge of
it charmed him inexpressibly. His eyes were almost
as bright, his cheeks as pink with excitement, as her
own. Only he must be very careful indeed. The
least mistake on his part would close the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Months, Nixie?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, yes, a single breath is months long,’ she
whispered, her eyes growing in size, and darkening
with wonder and awe. ‘Pouf lies on me and breathes
twice to my once, but I breathe millions of times—ever
so many millions—as I lie on the earth’s body.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>And it breathes in and out just as Pouf and I do.
Winter is breathing in, and summer is breathing out,
you see.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So the equinoctial gales are the changes from one
breath to the other?’ he put in gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I hadn’t thought about the—the gales,’ she said,
putting her face closer and lowering her voice, ‘but
I know that in the summer I often hear the earth
breathing out—’specially on still warm nights when
everything lies awake and listens for it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then do “Things” really listen as we do?’ he
asked gently.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not ’xactly as we do. We only listen in one
place—our ears. They listen all over. But they’re
alive just the same, though so much quieter. Oh,
Uncle Paul, everything is alive; everything, I know
it!’ She fixed a searching look on him. ‘You
knew <em>that</em>, didn’t you?’</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a trace of real surprise and disappointment
in her voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Well,’ he answered truthfully, ‘I had often and
often thought about it, and wondered sometimes—whether——’</p>

<p class='c011'>But the child interrupted him almost imperiously.
He realised sharply how the knowledge that the
years bring—little, exact, precise knowledge—may
kill the dreams of the naked soul, yet give nothing
in their place but dust and ashes. And, by the same
token, he recognised that his own heart was still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>untouched, unspoiled. The blood leaped and ran
within him at the thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The winds, too, are alive,’—she spoke with a
solemn excitement that made her delicate face flush
as though a white fire glowed suddenly beneath the
skin and behind the charming eyes—‘they run
about, and sleep, and sing, and are full of voices.
The wind has hundreds of voices—just like insects
with such a lot of eyes.’ (Even her strange simile
did not make him smile, so real was the belief and
enthusiasm of her words.) ‘<em>We</em> (with scorn) have
only one voice; but the wind can laugh and cry at
the same time!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’ve heard it,’ he put in, secretly thrilled.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I know its angry voice as well as its pretended-angry
voice, when it’s very loud but means nothing
in particular. Its baby-voice, when it comes through
the keyhole at night, or down the chimney, or just
outside the window in the early morning, and tells
me all its little very-wonderful-indeed aventures,
makes me so happy I want to cry and laugh at
once.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She paused a moment for breath, dimly conscious,
perhaps, that her description was somewhat confused.
Her excitement somehow communicated itself to
Pouf at the same time, for the kitten suddenly rose
up with an arched back and indulged in a yawn that
would have cracked the jaws of any self-respecting
creature. After a prolonged stare at Paul, it proceeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>inconsequently to wash itself with an air that
plainly said, ‘You won’t catch me napping again. <em>I</em>
want to hear this too.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul, meanwhile, stared at the child beside him,
thinking that the gold-dust on her hair must surely
come from her tumbling journeys among the stars,
and wondering if she understood how deeply she
saw into the heart of things with those dreamy blue
eyes of hers.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Listen, Nixie, you fairy-child, and I’ll tell you
something,’ he said gently, ‘something you will like
very much’; and, while she waited and held her
breath, he whispered softly in her ear:</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>‘That’s very pretty, I think,’ she said politely,
staring at him, with a little smile, half puzzled.
The music of the words had touched her, but she
evidently did not grasp why he should have said it.
She waited a minute to see if he had really finished,
and then went on again with her own vein of
thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then please tell me, Uncle,’ she asked gravely,
with deep earnestness, ‘what is it people lose when
they grow up?’</p>

<p class='c011'>And he answered her with equal gravity, speaking
seriously as though the little body at his side were
habited by an old, discriminating soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Simplicity, I think, principally—and vision,’ he
said. ‘They get wise with so many little details
called facts that they lose the great view.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The child watched his face, trying to understand.
After a pause she came back to her own thinking—the
sphere where she felt sure of herself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>‘They never see things properly once they’re
grown up,’ she said sadly. ‘They all walk into a
fog, <em>I</em> believe, that hides all the things <em>we</em> know,
and stuffs up their eyes and ears. Daddy called it
the cotton-wool of age, you know. Oh, Uncle, I
do hope,’ she cried with the sudden passion of the
child, ‘I <em>do</em> hope I shall never, never get into that
horrid fog. <em>You</em> haven’t, and I won’t, won’t,
won’t!’ Her voice rose to a genuine cry. Then
she added with a touch of child-wonder that followed
quite naturally upon the outburst, ‘How did you
ever stop yourself, I wonder!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I lived with the fairies in the backwoods,’ he
answered, laughing softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>She stared at him with complete admiration in
her blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then I shall grow up ’xactly like you,’ she said,
‘so that I can always get out of the cage just as you
do, even if my body is big.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Every one’s thin somewhere,’ Paul said, remembering
her own explanation. ‘And the Crack
into Yesterday and To-morrow is always close by
when it’s wanted. That’s the real way of escape.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She clapped her hands and danced, shaking her
hair out in a cloud and laughing with happiness.
Paul took her in his arms and kissed her. With a
gesture of exquisite dignity, such as animals show
when they resent human interference, the child
tumbled back into her chair by the table, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>expression of polite boredom—though the faintest
imaginable—in her eyes. Many a time had he seen
the kittens behave exactly in the same way.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But how do you know all these things, Nixie,
and where do all your ideas come from?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They just come to me when I’m thinking of
nothing in particular. They float into my head of
their own accord like ships, little fairy ships, I
suppose. And I think,’ she added dreamily after a
moment’s pause, ‘some of them are trees and flowers
whispering to me.’ She put her face close to his
own across the table, staring into his very brain with
her shining eyes. ‘Don’t you think so too, Uncle?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I think I do,’ he answered honestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Though some of the things I hear,’ she went on,
‘I don’t understand till a long time afterwards.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What kind of things, for instance?’</p>

<p class='c011'>She hesitated, answering slowly after a pause:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Things like streams, and the dripping of rain,
and the rustling of wet leaves, perhaps. At the time
I only hear the noise they make, but afterwards, when
I’m alone, doing nothing, it all falls into words and
stories—all sorts of lovely things, but <em>very</em> hard to
remember, of course.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She broke off and smiled up into his face with a
charm that he could never have put into words.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You’ll grow up a poet, Nixie,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Shall I <em>really</em>? But I could never find the
rhymes—simply never.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>‘Some never do,’ he answered; ‘and some—the
majority, I think—never find the words even!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, how dreadful!’ she exclaimed, her face
clouding with a pain she could fully understand.
‘Poets who can’t talk at all. I should think they
would burst.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Some of them nearly do,’ he exclaimed, hiding a
smile; ‘they get very queer indeed, these poor poets
who cannot express themselves. I have known one
or two.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Have you? Oh, Uncle Paul!’ Her tone
expressed all the solemn sympathy the world could
hold.</p>

<p class='c011'>He nodded his head mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c011'>The child suddenly sat up very erect. An idea of
importance had come into her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then I wonder if Pouf and Smoke, and Zezette
and Mrs. Tompkyns are like that,’ she cried, her face
grave as a hanging judge—‘poets who can’t express
themselves, and may burst and get queer! Because
they understand all that sort of thing—scuttling
leaves and dew falling, and tickling grasses and the
dreams of beeties, and things we never hear at all.
P’raps that’s why they lie and listen and think for
such ages and ages. I never thought of that
before.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s quite likely,’ he replied with equal solemnity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie sprang to her feet and flew round the room
from chair to chair, hugging in turn each kitten, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>asking it with a passionate earnestness that was very
disturbing to its immediate comfort in life: ‘Tell
me, Pouf, Smoke, Sambo, this instant! Are you all
furry little poets who can’t tell all your little furry
poems? Are you, <em>are you</em>, <span class='fss'>ARE YOU</span>?’</p>

<p class='c011'>She kissed each one in turn. ‘Are you going to
burst and get queer?’ She shook them all till,
mightily offended, they left their thrones and took
cover sedately under tables and sofas well out of
reach of this intimate and public cross-examination.
And there they sat, looking straight before them, as
though no one else existed in the entire world.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I believe they are, Uncle.’</p>

<p class='c011'>A silence fell between them. Under the furniture,
safe in their dark corners, the cats began to purr
again. Paul got up and strolled to the open window
that looked out across lawns and shrubberies to the
fringe of oaks and elms that marked the distant
hayfields. The rain still fell gently, silently—a fine,
scented, melancholy rain; the rain of a minor key.
Tinged with a hundred delicate odours from fields
and trees—ghostly perfumes far more subtle than
the perfumes of flowers—the air seemed to brush the
surface of his soul, dropping its fragrance down into his
heart like the close presence of remembered friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>The evening mode invaded him softly, soothingly;
and out of it, in some way he scarcely understood,
crept something that brought a vague disquiet in its
train. A little timid thought stole to the threshold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>of his heart and knocked gently upon the door of
its very inmost chamber. And the sound of the
knocking, faint and muffled though it was, woke
echoes in this secret chamber that proclaimed in a
tone of reproach, if not almost of warning, that
it was still empty and unfurnished. A deep, infinite
yearning, and a yearning that was <em>new</em>, stirred within
him, then suddenly rose to the surface of his mind
like a voice calling to him from far away out of
mist and darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If only I had children of my own...!’ it
called; and the echo whispered afterwards ‘of my
very own, made out of my very thoughts...!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned to Nixie who had followed, and now
leaned beside him on the window-sill.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So the language of wind and trees and water
you translate afterwards into stories, do you?’ he
asked, taking up the conversation where they had
left it. It was hardly a question; he was musing
aloud as he gazed out into the mists that gathered
with the dusk. ‘It’s all silent enough now, at
any rate there’s not a breath of air moving. The
trees are dreaming—dreaming perhaps of the Dance
of the Winds, or of the love-making of the snow
when their leaves are gone and the flakes settle softly
on the bare twigs; or perhaps dreaming of the
humming of the sap that brings their new clothes
with such a rush of glory and wonder in the
spring——’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Again the child looked up into his face with
shining eyes. The magic of her little treasured
beliefs had touched the depths of him, and she
felt that they were in the same world together,
without pretence and without the barriers of age.
She was radiantly happy, and rather wonderful into
the bargain, a fairy if ever there was one.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They’re just thinking,’ she said softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So trees think too?’</p>

<p class='c011'>She nodded her head, leaning her chin on her
hands as she gazed with him into the misty air.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I wonder what their thoughts are like,’ he
said musingly, so that she could take it for a question
or not as she chose.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Like ours—in a way,’ she answered, as though
speaking of something she knew beyond all question,
‘only not so small, not so sharp. Our thoughts
prick, I think, but theirs stroke, all running quite
smoothly into each other. Very big and wonderful indeed
thoughts—big as wind, I mean, and wonderful
as sky or distance. And the streams—the streams
have long, winding thoughts that run down their
whole length under water——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And the trees, you were saying,’ he said, seeing
that her thought was wandering.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes, the trees,’ she repeated, ‘oh! yes, the
trees are different a little, I think. A wood, you
see, may have one big huge thought all at once——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘All at once!’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>‘I mean all at the same time, every tree thinking
the same thought for miles. Because, if you lie in
a wood, and don’t think yourself, but just wait and
wait and wait, you gradgilly get its great thought
and know what it’s thinking about exactly. You
feel it all over instead of—of——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Instead of getting a single little sharp picture
in your mind,’ Paul helped her, grasping the wonder
of her mystical idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I think that’s what I mean,’ she went on. ‘And
it’s exactly the same with everything else—the sea,
and the fields, and the sky—oh! and everything in
the whole world.’ She made a sweeping gesture
with her arm to indicate the universe.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, Nixie child!’ he cried, with a sudden
enthusiasm pouring over him from the strange
region where she had unknowingly led him, ‘if only
I could take you out to the big woods I know
across the sea, where the trees stretch for hundreds
of miles, and the moss is everywhere a foot thick,
and the whole forest is such a conspiracy of wonder
and beauty that it catches your heart away and
makes you breathless with delight! Oh, my child,
if only you could hear the thoughts and stories of
woods like that—woods untouched since the beginning
of the world——!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Take me! Take me! Uncle Paul, oh! take
me!’ she cried as though it were possible to start
next day. ‘These woods are such <em>little</em> woods, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>I know all their stories.’ She danced round him
with a wild and eager delight.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Such stories, yes, such stories,’ Paul continued,
his face shining almost as much as hers as he
thought of his mighty and beloved forests.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Please tell me, take me, tell me!’ she cried.
‘All, all, all! Quick!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I can’t. I never understood them properly;
only the old Indians know them now,’ he said sadly,
leaning out of the window again with her. ‘They
are tales that few people in this part of the world
could understand; in a language old as the wind,
too, and nearly forgotten. You see, the trees are
different there. They stand in thousands—pine, hemlock,
spruce, and cedar—mighty, very tall, very straight,
very dark, pouring day and night their great balsam
perfumes into the air so that their stories and their
thoughts are sweet as incense and very mysterious.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie took the lapels of his coat in her hands
and stared up into his face as though her eyes would
pop out. She looked <em>through</em> his eyes. She saw
these very woods he was speaking of standing in
dim shadows behind him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘No one ever comes to disturb their lives, and
few of them have ever heard the ringing of the
axe. Only giant moose and caribou steal silently
beneath their shade, and Indians, dark and soft-footed
as things of their own world, make camp-fires
among their roots. They know nothing of men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>and cities and trains, and the wind that sings through
their branches is a wind that has never tasted
chimney-pots, and hot crowds, and pretty, fancy
gardens. It is a wind that flies five hundred miles
without taking breath, with nothing to stop its
flight but feathery tree-tops, brushing the heavens,
and clean mountain ridges thrusting great shoulders
to the stars. Their thoughts and stories are difficult
to understand, but <em>you</em> might understand them,
I think, for the life of the elements is strong in your
veins, you fairy daughter of wind and water. And
some day, when you are stronger in body—not older
though, mind, not older—I shall take you out there
so that you may be able to learn their wonder and
interpret it to all the world.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The words tore through him in such curious,
impersonal fashion, that he hardly realised he was
giving utterance to a longing that had once been
his own, and that he was now seeking to realise
vicariously in the person of this little poet-girl beside
him. He stroked her hair as she nestled up to
him, breathing hard, her eyes glistening like stars,
speechless with the torrent of wonder with which
her big uncle had enveloped her.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Some day,’ she murmured presently, ‘some day,
remember. You promise?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I promise.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And—and will you write that all out for me,
please?’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>‘All what?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘About the too-big woods and the too-old
language and the winds that fly without stopping,
and the stories——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, oh!’ he laughed; ‘that’s another matter!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes, oh you must, Uncle! Make a story of
it—an aventure. Write it out as a verywonerfulindeedaventure,
and put you and me in it!’ She
forgot the touch of sadness and clapped her hands
with delight. ‘And then read it out at a Meeting,
don’t you see?’</p>

<p class='c011'>And in the end Paul promised that too, making
a great fuss about it, but in his heart secretly pleased
and happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’ll try,’ he said, with portentous gravity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The child stared up at him with the sure knowledge
in her eyes that between them they held the
key to all that was really worth knowing.</p>

<p class='c011'>He stooped to kiss her hair, but before he could
do so, with a laugh and a dancing step he scarcely
heard, she was gone from his side and half-way
down the passage, so that he kissed the empty air.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Bless her mighty little heart!’ he exclaimed,
straightening himself up again. ‘Was there ever
such a teacher in the world before?’</p>

<p class='c011'>He became aware that the world held powers,
gentle yet immense, that were urging him in directions
hitherto undreamed of. With such a fairy guide
he might find—he was already finding—not merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>safety-valves of expression, but an outlet into the
bargain for his creative imagination.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And a little child shall lead them,’ he murmured
in his beard, as he went slowly down the passage
to his room to dress for dinner. Again he felt like
singing.</p>

      <div class='line'>only a green thing standing in the way.—W.B.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Thus, gradually, the grey house under the hills
changed into a palace; the garden stretched to
include the stars; and Paul, the retired Wood
Cruiser, walked in a world all new and brilliant.
For to find the means of self-expression is to
build the foundations of spiritual health, and an
ideal companionship, unvexed by limitations of
sense, holds potentialities that can change earth
into heaven. His accumulated stores of imagination
found wings, and he wrote a series of Aventures
that delighted his audience while they healed
his own soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I wish they’d go on for ever and ever,’ observed
Toby solemnly to her brother. ‘Perhaps they do
really, only——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course they do,’ Jonah said decisively, ‘but
Uncle Paul only tells bits of them to us—bits that
<em>you</em> can understand.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Toby was too much in earnest to notice the
masculine scorn.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>‘He does know a lot, doesn’t he?’ she said.
‘Do you think he sees up into heaven? They’re
not a bit like made-up aventures.’ She paused,
deeply puzzled; very grave indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘He’s a man, of course,’ replied Jonah. ‘Men
know big things like that.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The Aventures are true,’ Nixie put in gently.
‘That’s why they’re so big, and go on for ever and
ever.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s jolly when he puts us in them too, isn’t
it?’ said Jonah, forgetting the masculine pose in
his interest. ‘He puts me in most,’ the boy added
proudly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But <em>I</em> do the funniest things,’ declared Toby,
slightly aggrieved. ‘It was me that rode on the
moose over the tree-tops to the North Pole, and
understood all it said——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s nothing,’ cried her brother, making a
huge blot across his copy-book. ‘He had to get
me to turn on the roarer boryalis.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nixie’s always leader, anyhow,’ replied the child,
losing herself for a moment in the delight of that
tremendous blot. She often borrowed Nixie in this
way to obliterate Jonah when her own strength was
insufficient.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course she is,’ was the manly verdict. ‘She
knows all those things almost as well as Uncle Paul.
Don’t you, Nixie?’</p>

<p class='c011'>But Nixie was too busy cleaning up his blot with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>bits of torn blotting-paper to reply, and the arrival
of Mlle. Fleury put an end to the discussion for
the moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Paul himself, as the big child leading the
littler children, or following their guidance when
such guidance was clear, accepted his new duties
with a happy heart. His friendship with them all
grew delightfully, but especially, of course, his
friendship with Nixie. This elemental child slipped
into his life everywhere, into his play, as into his
work; she assumed the right to look after him;
with charming gravity she positively mothered him;
and Paul, whose life hitherto had known little
enough of such sympathy and care, simply loved it.</p>

<p class='c011'>If her native poesy won his imagination, her
practical interest in his welfare and comfort equally
won his heart. The way she ferreted about in his
room and study, so serious, so thoughtful, attending
to so many little details that no one else ever thought
of,—all this came into his life with a seductive charm
as of something entirely new and strange to him. It
was Nixie who always saw to it that his ink-pot was
full and his quill pens trimmed; that flowers had no
time to fade upon his table; and that matches for
his pipes never failed in the glass match-stands. He
used up matches, it seemed, almost by the handful.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You’re far worse than Daddy used to be,’ she
reproved him. ‘I believe you eat them.’ And
when he assured her that he did nothing of the sort,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>she only shook her head darkly, and said she
couldn’t understand then what he did with them
all.</p>

<p class='c011'>A hundred services of love and kindness she did
for him that no one else would have thought of.
On his mantelpiece she put mysterious little bottles
of medicine.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘For nettle-stings and scratches,’ she explained.
‘Your poor hands are always covered with them
both when you’ve been out with us.’ And it was
she, too, who bound up his fingers when wounds
were more serious, and saw to it that he had a clean
rag each day till the sore was healed. She put the
new red riband on his straw hat after it fell (himself
with it) into the Gull Pond; and one service
especially that earned her his eternal respect was to
fasten his evening black tie for dinner. This she did
every night for him. Such tasks were for magical
fingers only. He had never yet compassed it himself.
He would run to the nursery to say good-night, and
Nixie, looking almost unreal and changeling in her
white nightgown, with her yellow hair top-knotted
quaintly for sleep, would deftly trim and arrange the
strip of satin that he never could manage properly
himself. It was a regular little ritual, Toby watching
eagerly from the bed across the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Uncle
Paul,’ she said another time, holding up a mysterious
garment, ‘I never saw such holes—never!’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>And then she darned the said socks with results
that were picturesque if not always entirely satisfactory.
And once she sewed the toes so tightly
across with her darning that he could not get his
foot into them. She allowed no one else to touch
them, however. Little the child guessed that while
she patched his clothes, she wove his life afresh at
the same time.</p>

<p class='c011'>And with all the children he took Dick’s place
more and more. His existence widened, filled up;
he felt in touch with real things as of old in the
woods; the children replaced the trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was Nixie in particular who crept close to
his unsatisfied heart and tied him to her inner life
with the gossamer threads of her sand-coloured hair.
This elfin little being, with her imagination and
tenderness, brought to him something he had never
known before, never dreamed of even; a perfect
companionship; a companionship utterly unclouded.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the other children understood it; there was
no jealousy; it was not felt by them as favouritism.
Natural and right it seemed, and was.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You must ask Nixie,’ Jonah would say in reply
to any question concerning his uncle’s welfare or
habits. ‘She’s his little mother, you know.’</p>

<p class='c011'>For, truth to tell, they were born, these two, in
the same corner of the world of fantasy, bred under
the same stars, and fathered by the same elemental
forces. But for the trick of the years and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>accident of blood, they seemed made for one another
ideally, eternally.</p>

<p class='c011'>Things he could speak of to no one else found in
her a natural and easy listener. To grown-ups he
had never been able to talk about his mystic longings;
the very way they listened made such things
instantly seem foolish. But Nixie understood in her
child-way, not because she was sympathetic, but
because she was <em>in and of</em> them. He was merely
talking the language of her own world. He no
longer felt ashamed to ‘think aloud.’ Most people
were in pursuit of such stupid, clumsy things—fame,
money, and other complicated and ugly things—but
this child seemed to understand that he cared
about Realities only; for, in her own simple way,
this was what she cared about too.</p>

<p class='c011'>To talk with her cleared his own mind, too, in a
way it had never been cleared before. He came to
understand himself better, and in so doing swept
away a great deal of accumulated rubbish; for he
found that when his thought was too confused to
make clear to her, it was usually false, wrong—not
real.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I can’t make that out,’ she would say, with a
troubled face. ‘I suppose, I’m not old enough yet.’
And afterwards Paul would realise that it was himself
who was at fault, not the child. Her instinct
was unerring; whereas he, with those years of
solitude behind him, sometimes lost himself in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>region where imagination, self-devouring, ran the
risk of becoming untrue, possibly morbid. Her
wholesome little judgments brought sanity and
laughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>For, like other mystical temperaments, what he
sought, presumably, was escape from himself, yet
not—and herein he differed healthily from most of
his kidney—so much from his Real Inner Self, as
from its outer pettiness and limitations. True, he
sought union with something larger and more
perfect, and in so far was a mystic; but this larger
‘something,’ he dimly understood, was the star of
his own soul not yet emancipated, and in so far he
remained a man of action. His was the true, wholesome
mysticism; hysteria was not—as with most—its
chief ingredient. Moreover, this other, eternal
part of him touched Eternity. To be identified
with it meant to be identified with God, but never
for one instant to lose his own individuality.</p>

<p class='c011'>And to express himself through the creative
imagination, to lose his own smallness by interpreting
beauty, he had always felt must be a half-way
house to the end in view. His inability, therefore,
to find such means of expression had always
meant something incalculably grave, something that
hindered growth. But now this child Nixie, in
some extraordinary yet utterly simple fashion, had
come to show him the way. It was wonderful past
finding out. He hardly knew himself how it had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>come about. Yet, there she was, ever by his side,
pointing to ways that led him out into expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>No woman could have done it. His two longings,
he came to realise, were actually one: the
desire to express his yearnings grew out of the
desire to find God.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so it was that the thought of her growing
up was horrid to him. He could not bear to think
of her as a ‘young woman’ moving in a modern
world where she would lose all touch with the
elemental forces of vision and simplicity whence
she drew half her grace and wonder. Already for
him, in some mystical fashion of spiritual alchemy,
she had become the eternal feminine, exquisitely
focused in the little child. With the advance of
years this must inevitably pass from her, as she
increased the distance from her source of inspiration.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nixie, you must promise never to grow up,’ he
would say, laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Because Aventures stop then, don’t they?’ she
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Partly that,’ he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And I should get tired, like mother; or stupid,
like the head gardener,’ she added. ‘I know. But
I don’t think I ever shall, somehow. I think I am
meant to be always like this.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The serious way she said this last phrase escaped
him at the time. He remembered it afterwards,
however.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>It was so delightful, too, to read out his stories
and aventures to her; they laughed over them,
and her criticisms often improved them vastly. He
even read her his first poem without shyness, and
they discussed each verse and talked about ‘stealing
Heaven’s fire,’ and the poor ‘sparks’ that never
grew into flames. The ‘kiss of fire’ she thought
must be wonderful. She also asked what a ‘lyre’
was. They made up other verses together too. But
though they laughed and she asked odd questions,
on the whole she grasped the sadness of the poem
perfectly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Let’s go and cry a bit somewhere,’ she remarked
quietly, her eyes very wistful. ‘It helps it out
awfully, you know.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He reminded her, however, of a sage remark of
Toby’s, to the effect that when men grew beards
they lost the power to cry. Quick as a flash, then,
she turned with one of her exquisite little bits of
unconscious poetry.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Let’s go to the Gwyle then, and make the stream
cry for us instead,’ she said gravely, with a profound
sympathy, ‘because everybody’s tears must get into the
water some time—and so to the sea, mustn’t they?’</p>

<p class='c011'>And on their way, what with jumping ditches
and flower-beds, they forgot all about the crying.
On the edge of the woods, however, she raced up
again to his side, her blue eyes full of a new wonder.
‘I know that wind of inspiration that your poetry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>said never blew for you,’ she cried. ‘I know where
it blows. Quick! I’ll show you!’ The pace
made him pant a bit; he almost regretted he had
mentioned it. ‘I know where it blows, we’ll catch
it, and you shall see. Then you can always, always
get it when you want it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And a little farther on, after wading through
deep bracken, they stopped, and Nixie took his hand.
‘Come on tiptoe now,’ she whispered
mysteriously. ‘Don’t crack the twigs with your
feet.’ And, smiling at this counsel of perfection, he
obeyed to the best of his ability, while she pretended
not to notice the series of explosions that followed
his tread.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a curve in the skirts of the wood where
they found themselves; a small inlet where the tide
of daylight flowed against the dark cliffs of the
firs, and then fell back. The thick trees held it at
bay so that only the spray of light penetrated
beyond, as from advancing waves. ‘Thus far and
no farther,’ very plainly said the pine trees, and the
sunshine lay there collected in the little hollow with
the delicious heat of all the summer. It was a corner
hitherto undiscovered by Paul; he saw it with the
pleasure of a discovery.</p>

<p class='c011'>And there, set brightly against the sombre background,
stood the slender figure of a silver birch
tree, all sweet and shining, its branches sifting the
sunshine and the wind; while behind it, standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>forth somewhat from the main body of the wood,
a pine, shaggy and formidable, grew close as though
to guard it. The picture, with its striking contrast,
needed no imagination to make it more appealing.
It was patent to any eye.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s <em>my</em> tree,’ said Nixie softly, with both
arms linked about his elbow and her cheek laid
against the sleeve of his coat. ‘My fav’rite tree.
And that’s where your winds of inspiration blow that
you said you couldn’t catch. So now you can always
come and hear them, you see.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul entered instantly into the spirit of her dream.
The way her child’s imagination seized upon inanimate
objects and incorporated them into the
substance of her own life delighted him, for it was
also his own way, and he understood it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then that old pine,’ he answered, pointing to
the other, ‘is my tree. See! It’s come out of the
wood to protect the little birch.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The child ran from his side and stood close to
them. ‘Yes, and don’t you see,’ she cried, her
eyes popping with excitement, ‘this is me, and that’s
you!’ She patted the two trunks, first the birch
and then the pine. ‘It’s us! I never thought of
that before, never! It’s you looking after me and
taking care of me, and me dancing and laughing
round you all the time!’ She ran back to his side
and hopped up to plant a kiss in his beard. He
quite forgot to correct her a’venturous grammar.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>‘Of course,’ he cried, ‘so it is. Look! The
branches touch too. Your little leaves run up
among my old needles!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie clapped her hands and ran to and fro,
laughing and talking, on errands of further discovery,
while Paul sat down to watch the scene and think
his own thoughts. It was just the picture to appeal
strongly to him. At any time the beauty of the
tree would have seized him, but with no one else
could he have enjoyed it in the same way, or spoken
of his enjoyment. While Nixie flitted here and
there in the sunshine, the little birch behind her
bent down and then released itself with a graceful
rush of branches as the pressure of the wind passed.
Against the blue sky she tossed her leafy hands;
then, with a passing shiver, stood still.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I wonder,’ ran his thought, ‘why poets need
invent Dryads when such an incomparable revelation
lies plain in one of the commonest of trees like
this?’ And, at the same moment, he saw Nixie dart
past between the fir trees and the birch, as though
the very Dryad he was slighting had slipped out to
chide him. Her hair spread in the sunshine like
leaves. In the world of trees here, surely, was the
very essence of what is feminine caught and imprisoned.
Whatever of grace and wonder emanate
from the face and figure of a young girl to enchant
and bewitch here found expression in the silver stem
and branches, in the running limbs so slender, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>twigs that bent with their cataracts of flying hair.
Seen against the dark pine-wood, this little birch tree
laughed and danced; over that silver skin ran,
positively, smiles; from the facets of those dainty
leaves twinkled mischief and the joys of innocence.
Here, in a word, was Nixie herself in the terms of
tree-dom; and, as he watched, the wind swept out
the branches towards him in a cluster of rustling
leaves,—and at the same instant Nixie shot laughing
to his side.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a second he hardly knew whether it was the
child or the silver birch that nestled down beside
him and began to murmur in his ear.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This is it, you see,’ she was saying; ‘and
there’s your wind of inspiration blowing now.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We shall have to alter the first verse then,’ he
said gravely:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The winds of inspiration blow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet <em>never</em> pass me by.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course, of course,’ she whispered, listening
half to her uncle, half to the rustle in the branches.
‘And now,’ she added presently, ‘you can always
come and write your poetry here, and it will be very-wonderfulindeed
poetry, you see. And if you
leave a bit of paper on the tree you’ll find it in the
morning covered with all sorts of things in very fine
writing—oh, but <em>very very</em> fine writing, so small
that no one can see it except you and me. One of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the Little Winds we saw, you know, will twine
round it and leave marks. And the big pine is you
and the birch is me, isn’t it?’ she ended with
sudden conviction.</p>

<p class='c011'>The game, of course, was after her own heart. Up
she sprang then suddenly again, picked a spray of
leaves from a hanging branch, and brought it back
to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And here’s a bit of me for a present, so that
you can’t ever forget,’ she said with a gravity that
held no smile. And she fastened it with much
tugging and arranging in his buttonhole. ‘A bit of
my tree, and so of me.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then I might leave a bit of paper in the water
too,’ he remarked slyly on their way home, ‘so as to
get the thoughts of the stream.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Easily,’ she said, ‘only it must be wrapped up
in something. I’ll get Jonah’s sponge-bag and lend
it you. Only you must promise faithfully to return
it in case we go to the seaside in the summer.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And perhaps some of those tears we were talking
about will stick on it and leave their marks before
they go on to the sea,’ he suggested.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, but they’d be too sad,’ she answered
quickly. ‘They’re much better lost in the sea,
aren’t they?’</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>Thus the poetry in his soul that he could not
utter, he lived.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Without any conscious effort of the imagination,
the instant Nixie, or the thought of her, stood beside
him—lo, he was in Fairyland. It was so real that it
was positively bewildering.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the rest of that quiet household, without
knowing it, contributed to its reality. For, to begin
with, the place was delightfully ‘out of the world’;
and, after that, the gradations between the two
regions seemed so easy and natural: the shadowy
personality of his sister; the dainty little French
governess flitting everywhere with her plaintive
voice in the wake of the elusive children; then the
children themselves—Jonah, the mischievous; Toby
with her shining face of onion skin; and, last of all,
the host of tumbling animals, the mysterious cats,
the kittens, all fluff and wonder; and the whole of
it set amid the scenery of flowers, hills, and sea. It
was impossible to tell exactly where the actual
threshold lay, this shifting, fluid threshold dividing
the two worlds; but there can be no question that
Paul passed it day by day without the least difficulty,
and that it was Nixie who knew all the quickest
short-cuts.</p>

<p class='c011'>And to all who—since childhood—have lived in
Fairyland and tasted of its sweet innocence and
loveliness, comes sooner or later the desire to transfer
something of these qualities to the outer world.
Paul felt this more and more as the days passed.
The wish to beautify the lives of others grew in him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>with a sudden completeness that proved it to have
been there latent all the time. Through the voices
of Nixie, Jonah, and Toby, as it were, he heard the
voices—those myriad, faint, unhappy voices—of the
world’s neglected children a-calling to him: ‘Tell
us the Aventures too!’—‘Take us with you through
that Crack!’—‘Show us the Wind, and let us climb
with you the Scaffolding of Night.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And Paul, listening in his deep heart, began to
understand that Nixie’s education of himself was but
a beginning: all unconsciously that elfin child was
surely becoming also his inspiration. This first
lesson in self-expression she had taught him was like
the trickle that would lead to the bursting of the
dam. The waters of his enthusiasms would presently
pour out with the rush of genuine power behind
them. What he had to say, do, and live—all forms
of self-expression—were to find a larger field of usefulness
than the mere gratification of his personal
sense of beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>As yet, however, the thought only played dimly
to and fro at the back of his mind, seeking a way of
escape. The greater outlet could not come all at
once. The germ of the desire lay there in secret
development, but the thing he should do had not
yet appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>So, for the time being, he continued to live in
Fairyland and write Aventures.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was really incalculable the effect of enchantment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>this little yellow-haired girl cast upon him—hard to
believe, hard to realise. So true, so exquisite was it,
however, that he almost came to forget her age, and
that she was actually but a child. To him she
seemed more and more an intimate companion of
the soul who had existed always, and that both he
and she were ageless. It was their souls that played,
talked, caressed, not merely their minds or bodies.
In her flower-like little figure dwelt assuredly
an old and ripened soul; one, too, it seemed to him
sometimes, that hardly belonged to this world
at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was that about their relationship which
made it eternal—it always had been somewhere,
it always would be—somewhere. No confinings
of flesh, no limitations of mind and sense,
no conditions of mere time and space, could lay
their burden upon it for long. It belonged most
sweetly to the real things which are conditionless.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, one of the chief effects of the world
of Faery, experts say, is that Time is done away
with; emotions are inexhaustible and last for ever,
continually renewing themselves; the Fairies dance
for years instead of only for a night; their minds
and bodies grow not old; their desires, and the
objects of their desires, pass not away.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So, unquestionably,’ said Paul to himself from
time to time as he reflected upon the situation, ‘I
am bewitched. I must see what there is that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>can do in the matter to protect myself from further
depredations!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet all he did immediately, so far as can be
ascertained among the sources of this veracious
history, was to collect the ‘Aventures’ already
written and journey with them one fine day to
London, where he had an interview of some length
with a publisher—Dick’s publisher. The result,
at any rate, was—the records prove it—that some
time afterwards he received a letter in which it
was plainly stated that ‘the success of such a book
is hard to predict, but it has qualities, both literary
and imaginative, which entitle it to a hearing’; and
thus that in due course the said ‘Adventures of a
Prisoner in Fairyland’ appeared upon the book-stalls.
For the publishers, being the foremost in
the land, took the high view that seemed almost
independent of mercenary calculations; and it is
interesting to note that the years justified their
judgment, and that the ‘Adventures’ may now be
found upon the table of every house in England
where there dwells a true child, be that child seven
or seventy.</p>

<p class='c011'>And any profits that Paul collected from the sale
went, not into his own pocket, but were put aside,
as the sequel shall show, for a secret purpose that
lay hidden at this particular stage of the story among
the very roots of his heart and being.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>The summer, meanwhile, passed quickly away,
and August melted into September, finding him
still undecided about his return to America.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the rest, there was no hurry. There was
another six months in which to make up his mind.
Meanwhile, also, he made frequent use of the
‘Crack,’ and the changes in his soul went rapidly
forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>One afternoon in late September he made his way
alone across the hills. Clouds blew thinly over a
sky of watery blue, driven by an idle wind the roses
had left behind. It seemed a day strayed from out
the summer that now found itself, thrilled and a
little confused, in the path of autumn—and summer
had sent forth this soft wind to bring it back to
the fold.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ‘Crack’ was always near at hand on such a
day, and Paul slipped in without the least difficulty.
He found himself in a valley of the Blue Mountains
hitherto unknown, and, so wandering, came presently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>to a bend of the river where the sand stretched
smooth and inviting.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment he stopped to watch the slanting
waves and listen, when to his sudden amazement he
saw upon the shore, half concealed by the reeds near
the bank—a human figure. A second glance showed
him that it was the figure of a young girl, lying
there in the sun, her bare feet just beyond reach of
the waves, and her yellow hair strewn about the face
so as to screen it almost entirely from view. A
white dress covered her body; she was slim, he saw,
as a child. She was asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul stood and stared.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Shall I wake her?’ was his first thought. But
his second thought was truer: ‘Can I help waking
her?’ And then a third came to him, subtle and
inexplicable, yet scarcely shaping itself in actual
language: ‘Is she after all <em>a stranger</em>?’</p>

<p class='c011'>Flying memories, half-formed, half-caught, ran
curiously through his brain. What was it in the
turn of the slender neck, in the lines of the little
mouth, just visible where he stood, that seemed
familiar? Did he not detect upon that graceful
figure lying motionless in repose some indefinable
signature that recalled his outer life? Or was it
merely that fancy played tricks, and that he reconstructed
a composite picture from the galleries of
memory, with the myriad expression and fugitive
magic of dream or picture—ideal figures he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>conjured with in the past and set alive in some inner
frame of his deepest thoughts? He was conscious
of a delicious bewilderment. A singular emotion
stirred in his heart. Yet the face and figure he
sought utterly evaded him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, the first sharp instinct to turn aside passed.
He accepted the adventure. Stooping down for a
stone, he flung it with a noisy splash into the river.
The girl opened her eyes, threw her hair back in a
cloud, and sat up.</p>

<p class='c011'>At once a wave of invincible shyness descended
upon Paul, rendering words or action impossible;
he felt ridiculously embarrassed, and sought hurriedly
in his mind for ways of escape. But, before any
feasible plan for undoing what was already done
suggested itself, he became aware of a very singular
thing—the face of the girl was covered! He
could not see it clearly. Something, veil-like and
misty, hung before it so that his eyes could not
focus properly upon the features. The recognition
he had half anticipated, therefore, did not
come.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this helped to restore his composure. It
was, in any case, futile to pretend he did not see her.
For one thing, he realised that she was staring at him
just as hard as he was staring at her. The very
next instant she rose and came across the hot sand
towards him, her hair flying loose, and both hands
outstretched by way of greeting. Again, the half-recognition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>that refused to complete itself swept
confusingly over him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this spontaneous and unexpected action had
an immediate effect upon him of another kind. His
embarrassment vanished. What she did seemed
altogether right and natural, and the beauty of the
girl drove all minor emotions from his mind. His
whole being rose in a wave of unaffected delight,
and almost before he was aware of it, he had stepped
forward and caught both her hands in his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>This strange golden happiness at first troubled
his speech.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But surely I know you!’ he cried. ‘If only I
could see your face——!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You ought to know me,’ she replied at once
with a laugh as of old acquaintance, ‘for you have
called for me often enough, I’m sure!’ Her voice
was soft; curiously familiar accents rang in it; yet,
as with the face, he knew not whose it was.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked up at him, and though he could not
make out the features, he discerned the expression
they wore—an expression of peace and confidence.
The girl trusted him delightfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then what hides you from me?’ he insisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>She answered him so low that he hardly caught
the words. Certainly, at the moment he did not
understand them, for happiness still confused him.
‘The body,’ she murmured; ‘the veil of the body.’</p>

<p class='c011'>She returned the firm and equal pressure of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>hands, and allowed him to draw her close. Their
faces approached, and he looked searchingly down
upon her, trying to pierce the veil in vain. The hot
sunshine fell in a blaze upon their uncovered heads.
The next moment the girl raised her lips to his,
and almost before he knew it they had kissed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet that kiss seemed the most natural thing in
the world; at a stroke it killed the last vestige of
shyness. Youth ran in his veins like fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Now, tell me exactly who you are, please,’ he
cried, standing back a little for an inspection, but
still holding her hands. They swung out at arm’s
length like children.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I think first you should tell me who you are,’
she laughed. ‘I want to be a mystery a little longer.
It’s so much more interesting!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaning backwards with her hair tumbling down
her neck, she looked at him out of eyes that he half
imagined, half knew. Laughter and gentleness
played over her like sunlight. Standing there,
framed against the reeds of the river bank, with the
blue waters behind and the wind and sky about her
head, Paul thought that never till this moment had he
understood the whole magic of a woman’s beauty.
Yet at the same time he somehow divined that she
was as much child as woman, and that something of
eternal youthfulness mingled exquisitely with her
suggestion of maturity.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course,’ he laughed in return, like a boy in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>mid-mischief, ‘that’s your privilege, isn’t it? My
name, then, is——’</p>

<p class='c011'>But there he stuck fast. It seemed so foolish to
give the name he owned in that other tinsel world;
it was merely a disguise like a frock-coat or evening
dress, or the absurd uniform he had once assumed to
deceive the children with. He almost felt ashamed
of the name he was known by in that world!</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Well?’ she asked slyly, ‘and have you forgotten
it quite?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m the <em>Man who saw the Wind</em>, for one thing,’
he said at length; ‘and, after that, well—I suppose
I’m the man who’s been looking for you without
knowing it all his life! Now do you know me?’ he
concluded triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You foolish creature! Of course <em>I</em> know you!’</p>

<p class='c011'>She came closer; the sunshine and the odour of
the flowers seemed to come with her. ‘It’s <em>you</em> who
couldn’t find <em>me</em>! I’ve been waiting for you to
claim me ever since—either of us can remember.’</p>

<p class='c011'>A queer, faint rush of memory rose upon him
from the depths—and was gone. For an instant it
seemed that her face half cleared.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then, in the name of beauty,’ he cried, starting
forward, ‘why can’t I see your face and eyes? Why
do I only see you partly——?’</p>

<p class='c011'>She hesitated an instant and drew back; she
lowered her eyes—he felt that—and the voice
dropped very low again as she answered:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>‘Because, as yet, you only know me—partly.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘As through a glass, darkly, you mean?’ he said,
half grave, half laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl took both his hands and pressed them
silently for a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘When you know me as I know you,’ she
whispered softly, ‘then—we shall know one another—see
one another—face to face. But even now,
in these few minutes, you have come to know me
better than you ever did before. And that is
something, isn’t it?’</p>

<p class='c011'>She moved quite close, passing her hands down
his bronzed cheeks and shaking his head playfully
as one might do to a loved child.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You take my breath away!’ gasped the
delighted man, too bewildered in his new happiness
to let the strangeness of her words perplex him
long. ‘But, tell me again,’ he added, slowly
releasing himself, ‘how it is that you know me so
well? Tell me again and again!’</p>

<p class='c011'>She replied demurely, standing before him like a
teacher before a backward pupil. ‘Because I have
always watched, studied, and loved you—from within
yourself. It was not my fault that you failed to
know me when I spoke. Perhaps, even now, you
would not have found me unless—in certain ways—through
the children—you had begun to come into
your own——’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul interrupted her, taking her in his arms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>while she made no effort to escape, but only laughed.
‘And I’ll take good care I never lose you again after
this!’ he cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You know, I wasn’t really asleep just now on the
sand,’ she told him a little later. ‘I heard you coming
all the time; only I wanted to see if you would pass
me by as you always did before.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s very odd and very wonderful,’ he said, ‘but
I never noticed you till to-day.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And very natural,’ she added under her breath,
so low that he did not hear.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Paul, moving beside her, murmured in his
beard, ‘If she’s not my Ideal, set mysteriously somehow
into the framework of one I already love—I
swear I don’t know who she is!’</p>

<p class='c010'>They made their way along the sandy shores of
the river, the waves breaking at their feet, the wind
singing among the reeds; never had the sunlight
seemed so brilliant, the day so wonderful and kind.
All nature helped them; playing their great game as
if it was the only game worth playing in the whole
world—the game loved from one eternity to another.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So the children have told you about me, have
they?’ he whispered into the ear that came just level
with his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And all you love, as well. Your dreams and
thoughts more than anything else—especially your
thoughts. You must be very careful with those;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>they mould me; they make me what I am. If you
didn’t think nicely of me—verynicelyindeed——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But I shall always think nicely, beautifully, of
you,’ he broke in eagerly, not noticing the familiar
touch of language.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You have so far, at any rate,’ she replied, ‘for
the yearning and desire of your imagination have
created me afresh.’ And he discerned the smile upon
her veiled face as one may see the sun only through
troubled glass, yet know its warmth and brilliance.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then it is because you are part and parcel of my
inner self that you seem so real and intimate and—true?’
he asked passionately.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course. I am in your very blood; I beat in
your heart; I understand your every passion and
emotion, because I am present at their birth. The
most fleeting of your dreams finds its reflection in
me; your spirit’s faintest aspiration runs through me
like a trumpet call; and, now that you have found
me, we need never, we <em>can</em> never, separate!’</p>

<p class='c011'>The passion of her words broke over his heart
like a wave. He felt himself trembling.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But it is all so swift and wonderful that it makes
me almost afraid—afraid it cannot last,’ he objected,
knowing all the time that his words were but a
common device to make his pleasure the more real.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If only, oh, if only I could carry you away with
me into that outer world——!’</p>

<p class='c011'>She laughed deliciously in his face. ‘It is from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>that very “outer world” that you have carried me
<em>in here</em>,’ she told him softly, ‘for I am always with
you.’ And with the words came that fugitive trick
of voice and gesture that made him certain he knew
her—then was gone again. ‘In the house with your
sister and the children,’ she continued; ‘when you
write your Aventures and your verses; in your daily
round of duties, small and great; and when you
lie down at night—ah! especially then—I curl up
beside you in your heart, and fly with you through
all your funny dreamland, and wake your dear eyes
with a kiss so soft you never know it. In your early
morning rambles, as in your reveries of the dusk, I
never leave you—because I cannot. All day long
I am beside you, though you little realise my
presence. I share half your pleasures and all your
pains. And in return you hand over to me half that
soul whose unuttered prayers have thus created me
afresh for your salvation.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But it must be my own voice speaking,’ he cried
inwardly, satisfied and happy beyond belief. ‘It is
the words of my own thoughts that I hear!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Because I am your own thoughts speaking,’ she
replied instantly, as though he had uttered aloud.
‘I lie, you see, behind your inmost thoughts!’</p>

<p class='c010'>They walked through sunny meadows, picking
their way among islands of wild flowers. There was
no sound but the murmur of wind and river, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>singing of birds. Fleecy clouds, here and there in
the blue, hung cool and white, watching them. The
whole world, Paul felt, listened without shyness.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And so it is that you love me without shyness,’
she went on, marvellously linking in with his thought;
‘I am intimate with you as your own soul, and our
relations are pure with the purity that was before
man. There can be no secrets between us, or
possibility of secrets, for your most hidden dreams
are also mine. So mingled with your ultimate being
am I, in fact, that sometimes you dare not recognise
me as separate, and all that appears on the surface of
your dear mind must first filter through myself.
Why!’ she cried, with a sudden rush of mischievous
laughter, ‘I even know what you are made of; why
your queer heart has never been able to satisfy itself—to
“grow up,” as you call it; and all about this
endless desire you have to find God, which is really
nothing but the search to find your true inner Self.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Tell me! tell me!’ he cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Besides the sun,’ she went on with a strange
swiftness of words, ‘there’s the wind and the rain
in you; yes, and moon and stars as well. That’s
why the fire and restlessness of the imagination for
ever tear you. No mere form of expression can
ever satisfy <em>that</em>, but only increase it; for it means
your desire to know reality, to know beauty, to
know your own soul; to know—God! Your
blood has kinship with those tides that flow through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>all space, even to the gates of the stars; dawns and
sunsets, moonrise and meteors haunt your thoughts
with their magic lights; wild flowers of the fields
and hillside nod beside you while you sleep; and
the winds, laughing and sighing, lift your dreams
upon vast wings and flash with them beyond the
edges of the universe!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Stop,’ he cried with passion, ‘you are telling all
my secrets.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I am telling them only to myself,’ she laughed,
‘and therefore to you. For I know all the fevers of
your soul. The wilderness calls you and the great
woods. You are haunted by the faces of the world’s
forgotten places. Your imagination plays with the
lightning about the mountain tops, and seeks primeval
forests and the shores of desolate seas....’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul listened spellbound while she put some of
the most intangible of his fancies into the language
of poetry. Yet she spoke with the quiet simplicity
of true things. The man felt his soul shake with
delight to hear her. Again and again, while she
spoke, the feeling came to him that in another
moment her face must clear and he would know her;
yet the actual second of recognition never appeared.
The girl’s true identity continued to evade him.
The enticing uncertainty added enormously to her
charm. It evoked in him even the sense of worship.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And this shall be the earnest of our ideal companionship,’
she whispered, holding up a spray of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>leaves which she proceeded to fasten into the buttonhole
of his coat; ‘the symbol by which you shall always
know me—the sign of my presence in your heart.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The top of her head, as she bent over the task,
was on a level with his lips, and when he stooped to
kiss it the perfumes of the earth—flowers, trees,
wind, water—rose about her like a cloud. Her hair
was hot with sunshine, all silken with the air of
summer. They were one being, growing out of the
earth that he loved—the old, magical, beautiful earth
that fed so great a part of his secret life from
perennial springs.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she drew away again from his caress he glanced
down and saw that what she had pinned into his coat
was a little cluster of leaves from the branch of a
silver birch tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then I, too, shall give you a sign,’ he said,
‘that shall mean the same as yours.’ And he picked
a twig of pine needles from a tree beside them and
twined it through a coil of her hair. Then, seizing
her hands, he swung her round in a dance till they
fell upon the river bank at last, tired out, and slept
the sleep of children.</p>

<p class='c011'>And after that, for a whole day it seemed, they
wandered through this summer landscape, following
the river to its source in the mountains, and then
descending on the farther side to the shores of a
blue-rimmed sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There are the ships,’ she cried, pointing to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>shining expanse of water; ‘and, see, there is <em>our</em>
ship coming for us.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And as she stood there, laughing with excitement
like a child, a barque with painted figure-head and
brown sails yielding to the wind, came towards them
over the waves, the bales of fruit upon her decks
scenting the air, the smell of rope and tar and salty
wood enticing them to distance and adventure.
Through the cordage the very sound of the wind
called to them to be off.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So at last we start upon our long, long voyage
together,’ she said mysteriously, blushing with pleasure,
and leading him down towards the ship.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And where are we to sail to?’ he asked; for the
flap of the sails and the waves beating against the
sides made resistance impossible. The sea-smells
were in his nostrils. He glanced down at the veiled
face beside him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘First to the Islands of the Night,’ she whispered
so low that not even the wind could carry it away;
‘for there we shall be alone.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And then——?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And then to the Islands of Delight,’ she murmured
more softly still; ‘for there we shall find the
lost children of the world—<em>our</em> children, and so be
happy with them ever after, like the people in the
fairy tales.’</p>

<p class='c010'>With something like a shock he realised that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>some one else was walking beside him, talking of
things that were real in a very different sense. He
had been out walking longer than he knew, and had
reached the house again. The autumnal mist already
drew its gauze curtains about the old building. The
smoke rose in straight lines from the chimneys,
melting into dusk. That other place of sunshine
and flowers had faded—sea, ship, islands, had all
sunk beneath the depths within him. And this other
person had been saying things for some minutes....</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I don’t believe you’ve been listening to a single
word, Paul. You stand there with your eyes
fixed on vacancy, and only nod your head and
grunt.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I assure you, Margaret, dear,’ he stammered,
coming to the surface as from a long swim under
water, ‘I rarely miss anything you say. Only the
Crack came so very suddenly. You were saying
that Dick’s niece was coming to us—Joan—er—Thingumybob,
and——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So you heard some of it,’ she laughed quietly,
relenting. ‘And I hope the Crack you speak about
is in your head, not in mine.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s everywhere,’ he said with his grave humour.
‘That’s the trouble, you see; one never knows——’
Then, seeing that she was looking anxiously at the
walls of the house and at the roof, he dropped his
teasing and came back to solid earth again. ‘And
how soon do you expect her?’ he asked in his most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>practical voice. ‘When does she arrive upon the
scene?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Why, Paul, I’ve already told you twice! You
really are getting more absent-minded every day.
Joan comes to-morrow, or the day after—she’s to
telegraph which—and stays here for as long as she
can manage—a fortnight or so, I expect. She works
herself to death, I believe, in town with those poor
children, and I want her to get a real rest before she
goes back.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Waifs, aren’t they?’ he asked, picking up the
thread of the discourse like a thing heard in a dream,
‘lost children of the slums?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes. You’ll see them for yourself probably, as
she has some of them down usually for a day in the
country. One can be of use in that way—and it’s
so nice to help. Dick, you know, was absorbed in
the scheme. You will help, won’t you, when the
time comes?’</p>

<p class='c011'>He promised; and they went in together to tea.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>‘This is him,’ cried Jonah breathlessly, pointing
with a hand that wore ink like a funeral glove.
‘I’ve got him this time. Look!’ And he waved
a half-sheet of paper in his uncle’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’ve made one too—oh, a beauty!’ echoed
Toby; ‘and I haven’t made half such a mess as
you.’ Three of her fingers were in mourning. A
crape-like line running from the nose to the corner
of the mouth, lent her a certain distinction. She,
too, waved a bit of paper in the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Mine’s the real Jack-of-the-Inkpot though, isn’t
he, Uncle Paul?’ exclaimed the boy, leaving the
schoolroom table, and running up to show it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They’re all real—as real as your awful fingers,’
decreed Paul.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had been explaining how to make the figure
of the Ink Sprite that leaves blots wherever he goes,
blackens penholders and fingers, and leaves his
crawly marks across even the neatest page of writing.
Two blots and a line-then fold the paper. Open
it again and the ink has run into the semblance of an
outlandish figure with countless legs and arms, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>fantastic head; something between a spider, a
centipede, and a sprite.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s Jack-of-the-Inkpot,’ he told them. ‘Half
the time he does his dirty work invisibly, and if he
touches blotting-paper—he vanishes altogether.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Jonah skipped about the room, waving his
hideous creation in the air. Toby, in her efforts to
make a still better one, almost climbed into the ink-stand.
Nixie sat on the window-sill, dangling her
legs and looking on.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Very little ink does it,’ explained Paul, frightened
at the results of his instruction. ‘You needn’t pour
it on! He works with the smallest possible material,
remember!’ His own fingers were no longer as
spotless as they might have been.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Look!’ shouted Jonah, standing on a chair and
ignoring the rebuke. ‘There he goes—just like a
black spider flying!’ He let his half-sheet drop
through the air, ink running down its side as it fell,
while Toby watched with the envy of despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul pounced upon the wriggling figure just in
time to prevent further funeral trappings. He
turned it face downwards upon the blotting-paper.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, oh!’ cried the children in the same breath;
‘it’s drank him up!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Drunk him up,’ corrected Paul, relieved by the
success of his manœuvre. ‘His feet touched the
blotting-paper, you see.’</p>

<p class='c011'>A pause followed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>‘You promised to tell us his song, please,’
observed Nixie from her perch on the window-sill.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This is it, then,’ he answered, looking round at
the smudged and solemn faces, instantly grown still.
‘To judge by appearances you know this Sprite
better than I do!</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Paul’s back was to the door. He was in the act
of making up a new verse, and declaiming it, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>he was aware that a change had come suddenly over
the room. It was manifest from the faces of the
children. Their attention had wandered; they were
looking past him—beyond him.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when he turned to discover the cause of the
distraction he looked straight into the grey eyes of a
woman—grave-faced, with an expression of strength
and sweetness. As he did so the opening words of
verse four slipped out in spite of themselves:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I’m the blackest of goblins,</div>
      <div class='line'>I revel in smears—’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>He smothered the accusing statement with a
cough that was too late to disguise it, while the grey
eyes looked steadily into his with a twinkle their
owner made no attempt to conceal. The same
instant the children rushed past him to welcome
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s Cousin Joan!’ they cried with one voice,
and dragged her into the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And this is Uncle Paul from America——’
began Nixie.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And he’s crammed full of sprites and things,
and sees the wind and gets through our Crack, and—and
climbs up the rigging of the Night——’
cried Jonah, striving to say everything at once
before his sisters.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And writes the aventures of our Secret S’iety,’
Toby managed to interpolate by speaking very fast
indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>‘He’s Recording Secre’ry, you see,’ explained
Nixie in a tone of gentle authority that brought
order into the scene. ‘Cousin Joan, you know,’
she added, turning gravely to her uncle, ‘is Visiting
I’spector.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Whose visits, however, are somewhat rare, I
fear,’ said the new arrival, with a smile. Her voice
was quiet and very pleasant. ‘I hope, Mr. Rivers,
you are able to keep the Society in better order than
I ever could.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The introduction seemed adequate. They shook
hands. Paul somehow forgot the signs of mourning
he wore in common with the rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Cousin Joan has a <em>real</em> Society in London, of
course,’ Nixie explained gravely, ‘a Society that
picks up <em>real</em> lost children.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘A-filleted with ours, though,’ cried Jonah
proudly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘’ffiliated, he means,’ explained Nixie, while
everybody laughed, and the boy looked uncertain
whether to be proud, hurt, or puzzled, but in the
end laughing louder than the rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Paul was alone a few minutes later, the
children having been carried off shouting to receive
the presents their ‘Cousin’ always brought them
on her rare visits from London, he was conscious
first of a curious sense of disappointment. That
strong-faced woman, grave of expression, with the
low voice and the rather sad grey eyes, he divined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>was the cause; though, for the moment, he could
not trace the feeling to any definite detail. In his
mind he still saw her standing in the doorway—a
woman no longer in her first youth, yet comely with
a delicate, strong beauty that bore the indefinable
touch of high living. It was peculiar to his intuitive
temperament to note the spirit before he
became aware of physical details; and this woman
had left something of her personality behind her.
She had spoken little, and that little ordinary; had
done nothing in act or gesture that was striking.
He did not even remember how she was dressed,
beyond that she looked neat, soft, effective. Yet,
there it was; something was in the room with him
that had not been there before she came.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first he felt vaguely that his sense of disappointment
had to do with herself. Not that he
had expected anything dazzling, or indeed had given
her consciously any thought at all. The male
creature, of course, hearing the name of a girl he
is about to meet, instinctively conjures up a picture
to suit her name. He cannot help himself. And
Joan Nicholson, apart from any deliberate process of
thought or desire on his part, hardly suited the
picture that had thus spontaneously formed in his
mind. The woman seemed too big for the picture.
He had seen her, perhaps, hitherto, only through his
sister’s eyes. It puzzled him. About her, mysteriously
as an invisible garment, was the atmosphere of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>things bigger, grander, finer than he had expected;
nobler than he quite understood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah, now, at last, he was getting at it. The
vague sense of disappointment was not with her; it
was <em>with himself</em>. Tested by some new standard
her mere presence had subtly introduced into the
room—into his intuitive mind—he had become
suddenly dissatisfied with himself. His play with
the children, he remembered feeling, had seemed all
at once insignificant, unreal, almost unworthy—compared
to another larger order of things her
presence had suggested, if not actually revealed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, in a flash of vision, the truth came to him.
It was with himself and not with her that he was
disappointed. He recalled scraps of the conversation.
It was, after all, nothing Joan Nicholson had
said; it was something Nixie had said. Nixie, his
little blue-eyed guide and teacher, had been up to
her wizard tricks again, all unconsciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Cousin Joan has a <em>real</em> Society in London, you
know—<em>a Society that picks up real lost children</em>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>That was the sentence that had done it. He felt
certain. Combined with the spiritual presentment
of the woman, this apparently stray remark had
dropped down into his heart with almost startling
effect—like the grain of powder a chemist adds to
his test tube that suddenly changes the colour and
nature of its contents. As yet he could not determine
quite what the change meant; he felt only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>that it was there—disappointment, dissatisfaction
with himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Cousin Joan has a <em>real</em> Society.’ She was in
earnest.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>Real</em> lost children’—perhaps potential Nixies,
Jonahs, Tobys, all waiting to be ‘picked up.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The thoughts ran to and fro in him like some one
with a little torch, lighting up corners and recesses
of his soul he had so far never visited. For thus it
sometimes is with the chemistry of growth. The
changes are prepared subconsciously for a long while,
and then comes some trivial little incident—a chance
remark, a casual action—and a match is set to the
bonfire. It flames out with a sudden rush. The
character develops with a leap; the soul has become
wiser, advanced, possessed of longer, clearer sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul was certainly aware of a new standard by
which he must judge himself; and, for all the
apparent slightness of its cause, a little reflection
will persuade of its truth. Real, inner crises of
a soul are often produced by causes even more
negligible.</p>

<p class='c011'>The desire, always latent in him, to be of some
use in the world, and to find the things he sought
by losing himself in some Cause bigger than
personal ends, had been definitely touched. It now
rose to the surface and claimed deliberate attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>What in the world did it matter—thus he
reflected while dressing for dinner—whether his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>personal sense of beauty found expression or not?
Of what account was it to the world at large, the
world, for instance, that included those ‘lost children’
who needed to be ‘picked up’? To what use did
he put it, except to his own gratification, and the
passing pleasure of the children he played with?
Were there no bigger uses, then, for his imagination,
uses nobler and less personal?...</p>

<p class='c011'>The thoughts chased one another through his
mind in some confusion. He felt more and more
dissatisfied with himself. He must set his house in
order. He really must get to work at something
<em>real</em>!</p>

<p class='c011'>Other thoughts, too, played with him while he
struggled with his studs and tie. For he noticed
suddenly with surprise that he was taking more
trouble with his appearance than usual. That black
tie always bothered him when he could not get the
help of Nixie’s fingers, and usually he appeared at
the table with the results of carelessness and despair
plainly visible in its outlandish shape. But to-night
he tied and re-tied, determined to get it right. He
meant to look his best.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet this process of beautifying himself was instinctive,
not deliberate. It was unconscious; he
did not realise what he had been about until he was
half-way downstairs. And then came another of
those swift, subtle flashes by which the soul reveals
herself—to herself. This ‘dressing up,’ what was it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>for? For whom? Certainly, he did not care a
button what Joan Nicholson thought of his personal
appearance. That was positive. Then, for whom,
and for what, was it? Was it for some one else?
Had the arrival of this ‘woman’ upon the scene
somehow brought the truth into sudden relief?...</p>

<p class='c011'>A delightful, fairy thought sped across his mind
with wings of gold, waving through the dusk of his
soul a spray of leaves from a silver birch tree that he
knew, and disappearing into those depths of consciousness
where feelings never clothe themselves in
precise language. A line of poetry swam up and
took its place mysteriously—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My heart has thoughts, which, though thine eyes hold mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Flit to the silent world and other summers,</div>
      <div class='line'>With wings that dip beyond the silver seas.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Could it be, then, that he had given his heart so
utterly, so exquisitely, into the keeping of a little
child?...</p>

<p class='c011'>At any rate, before he reached the drawing-room,
he understood that what he had been so busy dressing
up was not anything half so trumpery as his
mere external body and appearance. It was his
interior person. That black tie, properly made for
once, was an outward and visible sign of an inward
and spiritual grace; only, having forgotten, or
possibly never heard the phrase, he could not make
use of it!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>‘It’s that little, sandy-haired witch after all!’ he
thought to himself. ‘Joan’s coming—a woman’s
coming—has made me realise it. I must behave
my best, and look my best. It’s my soul dressing
up for Nixie, I do declare!’</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Persons with real force of purpose carry about
with them something that charges unconsciously the
atmosphere of others. Paul ‘felt’ this woman.
The first impact of her presence, as has been seen,
came almost as a shock. The ‘shocks,’ however,
did not continue—as such. Her influence worked
in him underground, as it were.</p>

<p class='c011'>She slipped easily and naturally into the quiet
routine of the little household in the Grey House
under the hill, till it seemed as if she had been there
always. Margaret had insisted at once that there
could be no ‘Missing’ and ‘Mistering’; Dick’s
niece must be Joan, and her brother Paul; and the
more familiar terms of address were adopted without
effort on both sides.</p>

<p class='c011'>The children helped, too. They were all in the
same Society, and before a week had passed she had
heard all the ‘aventures,’ and entered into the discovery
of new ones, even contributing some herself
with a zest that delighted  Paul, and made him feel
wholly at his ease with her. It was all real to her;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>she could not otherwise have shown an interest; for
sham had no part in her nature, and her love for
these fatherless children was as great as his own, and
similar in kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You have given their “Society” a new lease of
life,’ she told him; ‘you are an enormous addition
to it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Enormous—yes!’ he laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Enormously useful at the same time,’ she
laughed in return, ‘because you not only increase
their imagination; you train it, and show them how
to use it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘To say nothing of the indirect benefits I receive
myself,’ he added.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, after a pause, she said: ‘For myself, too,
it’s the best kind of holiday I could possibly have.
To come down here into all this, straight from my
waifs in London, is like coming into that Crack-land
you have shown them. I wish—I wish I could
introduce it all to my big sad world of unwashed
urchins. They have so few chances.’ A sudden
flash of enthusiasm ran over her face like sunlight.
‘Perhaps, when they come down here next week for
a day’s outing, we might try!—if you will help
me, that is?’ She looked up. Something in the
simple words touched him; her singleness of aim
stirred the depths in him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He promised eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘When it’s out,’ she added presently, ‘I’m going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>to give copies of your book of aventures to some of
them. A good many will understand——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You shall have as many as you can use,’ he put
in quickly, with a thrill of pleasure he hardly understood.
‘I’m only too delighted to think they could
be of any use—any <em>real</em> use, I mean.’</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something in the simple earnestness of
this woman, in the devotion of her life to an unselfish
Cause, that increased daily his dissatisfaction with
himself. She never said a word that suggested self-sacrifice.
A call had come to her, turning her entire
life into an instrument for helping others—others
who might never realise enough to say, ‘Thank you’—and
she had accepted it. Now she lived it, that was
all. The Scheme that had provided the call, too,
was Dick’s. It was all conceived originally in that
big practical, imaginative heart of the one intimate
friendship he had known. Moreover, it concerned
children, lost children. The appeal to the deepest
in himself was thus reinforced in several ways.
More and more, beside this quiet, determined
woman, with her singleness of aim and her practical
idealism, his own life seemed trivial, cheap, selfish.
She had found a medium of expression, self-expression,
compared to which his own mind was
insignificant.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the ‘Man who splashed on the Deck’ to
Joan Nicholson was a far cry; as far almost as from
the amœba to the dog—yet both the man and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>woman knew the relief of Outlet. And, now, he
too was learning in his own time and place the same
truth. Nixie had brought him far. Joan, perhaps,
was to bring him farther still.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet there was nothing about her that was very
unusual. There are scores and scores of unmarried
women like her sprinkled all along the quiet ways of
life, noble, unselfish, unrecognised, often, no doubt,
utterly unappreciated, turning the whole current of
their lives into work for others—the best they can
find. The ordinary man who, for the mother of his
children seeks first of all physical beauty, or perhaps
some worldly standard of attractiveness, passes them
by. Their great force, thus apparently neglected by
Nature for her more obvious purposes, runs along
through more hidden channels, achieving great things
with but little glory or reward. To Paul, who knew
nothing of modern types, and whose knowledge of
women was abstract rather than concrete, she
appeared, of course, simply normal. For all women
he conceived as noble and unselfish, capable naturally
of sacrifice and devotion. To him they were all
saints, more or less, and Joan Nicholson came upon
the scene of his life merely as an ordinarily presentable
specimen of the great species he had always dreamt
about.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was the first time he had come into close
contact with a living example of the type he had
always believed in. Here was a woman whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>interests were all outside herself. The fact thrilled
and electrified him, just as the peculiar nature of her
work made a powerful and intimate appeal to his
heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the days passed, and they came to know one
another better, she told him frankly about the small
beginnings of her work, and then how Dick’s idea
had caught her up and carried her away to where
she now was.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There was so much to be done, and so much
help needed, that at first,’ she admitted, ‘my own
little efforts seemed absurd; and then he showed me
that if everybody talked like that nothing would ever
be accomplished. So I got up and tried. It was
something definite and practical. I let my bigger
dreams go——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Well done,’ he interrupted, wondering for a
moment what those ‘bigger dreams’ could have been.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘——and chose the certainty. And I have never
regretted it, though sometimes, of course, I am still
tempted——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That was fine of you,’ he said. He realised
vaguely that she would gladly, perhaps, have spoken
to him of those ‘other dreams,’ but it was not quite
clear to him that his sympathy could be of any avail,
and he did not know how to offer it either. To ask
direct questions of such a woman savoured to his
delicate mind of impertinence.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There was nothing “fine” about it,’ she laughed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>after an imperceptible pause; ‘it was natural, that’s
all. I couldn’t help myself really. Human suffering
has always called to me very searchingly. <i><span lang="fr">Au
fond</span></i>, you see, it was almost selfishness.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He suddenly felt unaccountably small with this
slip of a woman at his side, tired, overworked, giving
all her best years so gladly away, and even in her
‘holidays’ thinking of her work more than of herself.
He noticed, too, the passing flames that lit fires in her
eyes and illumined her entire face sometimes when
she spoke of her London waifs. Pity and admiration
ran together in his thoughts, the latter easily
predominating.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But you must make the most of your holiday,’
he said presently; ‘you will use up your forces too
soon——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Perhaps,’ she laughed, ‘perhaps. Only I get
restless with the feeling that I’m wanted elsewhere.
There’s so little time to do anything. The years
pass so quickly—after thirty; and if you always wait
till you’re “quite fit,” you wait for ever, and nothing
gets done.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul turned and looked steadily at her for a
moment. A sudden beauty, like a white and shining
fire, leaped into her face, flashed about the eyes and
mouth, and was gone. Paul never forgot that look
to the end of his days.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘By Jove,’ he said, ‘you <em>are</em> in earnest!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not more than others,’ she said simply; ‘not as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>much as many, even, I’m afraid. A good soldier goes
on fighting whether he’s “fit” or not, doesn’t he?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘He ought to,’ said Paul—humbly, for some
reason he could hardly explain.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had many similar talks. She told him a
great deal about her rescue work in London, and he,
for his part, became more and more interested.
From a distance, meanwhile, his sister observed
them curiously,—though nothing that was in
Margaret’s thoughts ever for a single instant found
its way either into his mind or Joan’s. It was
natural, of course, that Margaret, the reader of
modern novels, should have formed certain conclusions,
and perhaps it would have been the obvious
and natural thing for Joan and Paul to have fallen
in love and been happy ever afterwards with children
of their own. It would also, no doubt, have been
‘artistic,’ and the way things are made to happen in
novels.</p>

<p class='c011'>But in real life things are not cut always so
neatly to measure, and whether real life is artistic or
not as a whole cannot be judged until the true, far
end is known. For the perspective is wanting; the
scale is on a vaster loom; and of the threads that
weave into the pattern and out again, neither end
nor beginning are open to inspection.</p>

<p class='c011'>The novels Margaret delighted in, with their
hotch-potch of duchesses and valets, Ministers of
State and footmen, libertines and snobs, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>doubtless portraying certain phases of modern life
with accuracy, could in no way prepare her for the
Pattern that was being woven beneath her eyes by
the few and simple characters in this entirely
veracious history. And it may be assumed, therefore,
that Joan had come into the scenery of Paul’s life
with no such commonplace motive—since the high
Gods held the threads and wove them to their own
satisfaction—as merely to marry off the hero.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if Paul did not fall in love with Joan
Nicholson, as he might, or ought, to have done, he
at least did the next best thing to it. He fell head
over ears in love with her work. And since love
seeks ever to imitate and to possess, he cast about in
his heart for means by which he might accomplish
these ends. Already he possessed her secret. Now
he had only to imitate her methods.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was finding his way to a bigger and better
means of self-expression than he had yet dreamed of;
while Nixie, the <i><span lang="la">dea ex machina</span></i>, for ever flitted on
ahead and showed the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>It remained a fairy tale of the most delightful
kind. <em>That</em>, at least, he realised clearly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Among the branches of the ilex tree, whose thick
foliage rose like a giant swarm of bees at the end
of the lawn, there were three dark spots visible that
might have puzzled the most expert botanist until he
came close enough to examine them in detail. The
fact that the birds avoided the tree at this particular
hour of the evening, when they might otherwise have
loved to perch and sing, hidden among the dense
shiny leaves, would very likely have furnished a clue,
and have suggested to him—if he were a really
intelligent man of science—that these dark spots
were of human origin.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the order in which they rose from the ground
towards the top they were, in fact, Toby, Joan
Nicholson, Paul, Nixie and, highest of all, Jonah.
Paul felt safer in the big fork, Joan in the wide seat
with the back. In the upper branches Jonah
perched, singing and chattering. Toby hummed to
herself happily nearer the ground, and Nixie, her
legs swinging dizzily over a serpentine branch
immediately above Paul’s head, was really the safest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>of the lot, though she looked ready to drop at
any moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were all at rest, these wingless human birds,
in the tree where Paul had long ago made seats and
staircases and bell-ropes.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I wish the wind would come,’ said Nixie. ‘It
would make us all swing about.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And Jonah would lose his balance and bring the
lot of us down like ripe fruit,’ said Paul.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘On the top of Toby at the bottom,’ added Joan.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But my house is well built,’ Paul objected, ‘or
it would never have held such a lot of visitors as
it did yesterday.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Look out! I’m slipping!’ cried Jonah suddenly
overhead. ‘No! I’m all right again now,’ he added
a second later, having thoroughly alarmed the
lodgers on the lower floors, and sent down a
shower of bark and twigs.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s certainly more solid than your “Scaffolding
of Night,”’ Joan observed mischievously as soon as
the shower was past; ‘though, perhaps, not quite as
beautiful.’ And presently she added, ‘I think I
never saw boys enjoy themselves so much in my life.
They’ll remember it as long as they live.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It was your idea,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But you carried it out for me!’</p>

<p class='c011'>They were resting after prolonged labours that
had been, at the same time, a prolonged delight.
At three o’clock that afternoon, after twenty-four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>hours of sunshine among woods and fields, the party
of twenty urchins had been seen safely off the
premises into the London train. Two large brakes
had carried them to the station, and the gardens
of the grey house under the hill were dropping back
again into their wonted peace and quiet.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is nothing unusual—happily—in the sight
of poor town-children enjoying an afternoon in
the country; but there was something about this
particular outing that singled it out from the
majority of its kind. Paul had entered heart and
soul into it, and the combination of woods, fields,
and running water had made possible certain details
that are not usually feasible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Margaret had given Paul and her cousin <i><span lang="fr">carte
blanche</span></i>. They had planned the whole affair as
generals plan a battle. The children had proved
able lieutenants; and the weather had furnished the
sun by day and the moon by night, to show that
it thoroughly approved. For it was Paul’s idea that
the entire company of boys should camp out, cook
their meals over wood fires in the open, bathe in the
pools he had contrived long ago by damming up
the stream, and that not a single minute of the
twenty-four hours should they be indoors or under
cover.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a big barn close at hand in case of necessity,
and with four tents large enough to hold five apiece,
erected at the far end of the Gwyle woods, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>the stream ran wide and full, he had no difficulty
in providing for all contingencies. Each boy had
brought a little parcel with his things for the night;
and blankets, bedding of hay and pillows of selected
pine branches—oh, he knew all the tricks for
making comfortable sleeping-quarters in the woods!—were
ready and waiting when the party of urchins
came upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c011'>And every astonished ragamuffin had a number
pinned on to his coat the moment he arrived, and
the same number was to be found at the head of his
place in the tent. Each tent, moreover, was under
the care of a particular boy who was responsible for
order; while, midway in the camp, by the ashes of
the fire where they had roasted potatoes and told
stories till the moonlight shamed them into sleep,
Paul himself lay all night in his sleeping-bag, the
happiest of the lot, sentinel and guardian of the
troop.</p>

<p class='c011'>The place for the main fire, where meals were
cooked, had been carefully chosen beforehand, and
wood collected by the busy hands of Nixie &#38; Co.
The boys sat round it in a large ring; and Paul in
the middle, stirring the stew he had learned to make
most deliciously in his backwoods life, ladled it out
into the tin plates of each in turn, while Joan saw to
the bread and cake, and watched the huge kettle of
boiling water for tea that swung slowly from the
iron tripod near by.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>And that circle of happy urchin faces, seen
through the blue smoke against the background of
crowding tree stems, flushed with the hours of sunshine,
the mystery of happiness in all their eyes,
remained a picture in Paul’s memory to the end of
his life. The boys, certainly, were not all good, but
they were at least all merry. They forgot for the
time the heat of airless brick lanes and the clatter
of noisy traffic. The perfumes of the wood banished
the odour of ill-ventilated rooms. Dark shadows of
the streets gave place to veils of a very different
kind, as the rising moon dropped upon their faces
the tracery of pine branches. And, instead of the
roar of a city that for them meant hardship, often
cruelty, they heard the singing of birds, the rustle
of trees, and the murmur of the stream at their very
feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Paul, as he paced to and fro softly between
the sleeping crew, the tents all ghostly among the
trees, had long, long thoughts that went with him
into his sleeping-bag later and mingled with dreams
that were more inspired than he knew, and destined
to bear a great harvest in due course....</p>

<p class='c011'>The branches of big forest trees shifted noiselessly
forwards from the scenery that lay ever in the
background of his mind, and pressed his eyelids
gently into sleep. With feathery dark fingers they
brushed the surface of his thoughts, leaving the
perfume of their own large dreams about his pillow.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>The shadowy figures that haunt all ancient woods
peered at him from behind a million stems and,
while they peered, beckoned; whispering to his soul
the secrets of the wilderness, and renewing in him
the sources of strength, simplicity, and joy they had
erstwhile taught him.</p>

<p class='c011'>All that afternoon he had spent with the romping
boys, organising their play, seeing to it that they
enjoyed utter freedom, yet did no mischief. Joan
seconded him everywhere, and Nixie flitted constantly
between the camp and the source of supplies in the
kitchen. And, to see their play, came as a revelation
to him in many ways. While the majority were
content to shout and tumble headlong with excess of
animal spirits let loose, here and there he watched
one or two apart, all aghast at the beauty they saw
at close quarters for the first time; dreaming;
apparently stunned; drinking it all in with eyes and
ears and lips; feeling the moss and branches as
others feel jewels and costly lace; and on some of
the little faces an expression of grave wonder, and of
joy too deep for laughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This ain’t always ’ere, is it, Guv’nor?’ one had
asked. And another, whom Paul watched fingering
a common fern for a long time, looked up presently
and inquired if it was real—‘because it isn’t ’arf as
pretty as what <em>we</em> use!’ He was the son of a sceneshifter
at an East End theatre.</p>

<p class='c011'>And a detail that made peculiarly keen appeal to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>his heart, a detail not witnessed by Joan or the
children, was the morning ablutions in the stream,
when the occupants of each tent in turn, went into
the water soon after sunrise, their pinched bodies
streaked by the shadow and sunlight of the dawn,
their laughter and splashing filling the wood with
unwonted sounds. Soap, towels, and water in plenty!
Water perfumed from the hills! Faces flushed and
almost rosy after the sleep in the open, and the
inexhaustible draughts of air to fan them dry again!</p>

<p class='c011'>And then the eager circle for breakfast, hatless,
eyes all fixed upon the great stew-pot where he
mixed the jorum of porridge! And the noise—for
noise, it must be confessed, there was—as they
smothered it in their tin plates with quarts of milk
hot from the cow, and busily swallowed it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You took them straight into the Crack, you
know,’ Joan said from her seat below.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Everything came true,’ Nixie’s voice was heard
overhead among the branches.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jonah clattered down past them and scampered
across the lawn with Toby at his heels, for their
bedtime was close at hand. The other three lay
there, half hidden, a little longer, while the shadows
crept down from the hills and gathered underneath.
They could no longer see each other properly. For
a time there was silence, stirred only by the faint
rustle of the ilex leaves. Each was thinking long,
deep thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>‘Next week,’ said Joan quietly, as though to
herself, ‘the other lot will come. Your sister’s as
good as gold about it all.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, after a pause, Nixie’s voice dropped down
to them again:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And had some of them really never seen a
wood before?’ she asked. ‘Fancy that! When
I grow up I shall have a big wood made specially
for them—the “Wood for Lost Children” I shall
call it. And you’ll see about the tents and
cooking, won’t you, Uncle Paul? Or, perhaps,’ she added,
‘by that time I shall know how to make a real proper
stew and porridge, and be able to tell them stories
round the fire as you did. Don’t you think so?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I think you know most of it already,’ he
answered gently. ‘It seems to me somehow that you
have always known all the important things like that.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh, do you really? How splendid if I really
did!’ There was a slight break in her voice—ever
so slight. ‘I should so dreadfully like to help—if I
could. It’s so slow getting old enough to do anything.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul turned his head up to her. It was too dim
to see her body lying along the bough, but he could
just make out her eyes peering down between the
dark of the leaves, a yellow mist where her hair
was, and all the rest hidden. Very eerie, very suggestive
it was, to hear this little voice amid the dusk of the
branches, putting his own thoughts into words.
Were those tears that glistened in the round pools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>of blue, or was it the reflection of sunset and the
coming stars that filtered past her through the
thinning tree-top? Again he thought of that silver
birch standing under the protection of the shaggy
pine.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Sing us something, Nixie,’ rose the voice of
Joan from below.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What shall I sing?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That thing about the two trees Uncle Paul
made up.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But he hasn’t given me the tune yet!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The tune’s still lost,’ murmured the deep voice
from the shadows of the big fork. ‘I must go into
the Crack and find it. That’s where I found the
words, at least——’ The sound of his voice melted
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course,’ Joan was heard to say faintly, ‘all
lost things are in there, aren’t they?’</p>

<p class='c011'>And then something queer happened that was
never explained. Perhaps they all slipped through
the Crack together; or perhaps Nixie’s funny little
singing voice floated down to them through such
a filter of listening leaves that both words and tune
were changed on the way into something sweeter
than they actually were in themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘It’s all very well for you two to play at being
trees,’ the voice of Joan was heard to object, ‘but I
should like to know what part I——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Hush! Hush! I hear them coming,’ Nixie
said quickly with a new excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had apparently floated up higher into the
ilex to the place vacated by Jonah. Her voice had
a ring of the sky in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Come up to where I am, and we can <em>all</em> see.
They’re rising already——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Who—what’s rising?’ called Joan from below;
‘I’m not!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There’s something up, I expect,’ said Paul
quickly. ‘I’ll help you.’ He knew by the child’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>voice there was aventure afoot. ‘Give me your
hand, Joan. And put your feet where I tell you.
We’re all in the Crack, remember, so everything’s
possible.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Undoubtedly something’s up, but it’s not <em>me</em>,
I’m afraid,’ she laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Hush! Hush! Hush!’  Nixie’s voice reached
them from the higher branches. ‘Talk in whispers,
please, or you’ll frighten them. And be quick.
They’re rising everywhere. Any minute now they
may be off and you’ll miss them——’</p>

<p class='c011'>Joan and Paul obeyed; though in his record of
the aventure he never described the details of their
ascent. A few minutes later they were perched
beside the child near the rounded top of the
ilex.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s fearfully rickety,’ Joan said breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But there’s no danger,’ whispered Nixie, ‘because
this is an evergreen tree, and it doesn’t go with the
others.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘How—“Go with the others?”’ asked the two
in the same breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Trees,’ answered the child. ‘They’re emigrating.
Look! Listen!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Migrating,’ suggested Paul.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course,’ Nixie said, poking her head higher
to see into the sky. ‘Trees go away south in the
autumn just like birds—the real trees; their insides,
I mean——’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>‘Their spirits,’ Paul explained in his lowest
whisper to Joan.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s why they lose their leaves. And in the
spring they come back with all their new blossoms
and things. If they find nicer places in the south,
they stay, that’s all. They—die. Listen—you can
hear them going!’</p>

<p class='c011'>High up in that still autumn sky there ran a sweet
and curious sound, difficult to describe. Joan thought
it was like the rustle of countless leaves falling: the
tiny tapping noise made by a dying leaf as it settles
on the ground—multiplied enormously; but to Paul
it seemed that sudden, dream-like whirr of a host of
birds when they wheel sharply in mid-air—heard at
a distance. There was no question about the distance
at any rate.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Are they just the trees of our woods, then?’
asked Joan in a whisper that held delight and awe,
‘or——’</p>

<p class='c011'>The child laughed under her breath. ‘Oh, no,’
was the reply, ‘all the South of England below a
certain line meets here. This is one of the great
starting-places. It’s just like swallows collecting on
the wires. Some big tree, higher than the rest, gives
a sign one night—and then all the other woods flock
in by thousands. Uncle Paul knew <em>that</em>!’ There
was a touch in her voice of something between scorn
and surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Did you, Uncle Paul?’ Joan asked.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>He fidgeted in his precarious perch. ‘I write the
Record of it all, so I ought to,’ he answered
evasively.</p>

<p class='c011'>And high up in the autumn sky, now darkening,
ran on that curious sweet sound. Across the heavens,
silvery in the coming moonlight, they saw long
feathery clouds drawn thinly from north to south,
known commonly as mares’ tails.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Those are the tracks they follow,’ whispered
Nixie. ‘Look! Now you can see them—some of
them!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Her voice was so thrilled that it startled them.
But for the fact that they were in the Crack where
nothing can be ever ‘lost,’ both Paul and Joan might
have lost their hold and their seats—to say nothing
of their lives—and crashed downwards through the
branches of that astonished ilex tree. Instead, they
turned their eyes upwards and stared.</p>

<p class='c011'>They looked out over the world of tree-tops.
On all sides rose Something in a silent tempest,
almost too delicate for words—something that
touched the air with a Presence, swift and wonderful—then
was gone. With it went the faint music as
of myriad wheeling birds, too small for sight. And
through the sky ran a vast fluttering of green. They
saw the coming stars, as it were, through immense
transparencies of green, stained here and there with
the washed splendours of wet and dying leaves—the
greens, yellows, aye, and the reds too, of autumn.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>For a few passing seconds the night was positively
robed with the spirit-hues of the dying year, rising
rapidly in the sheets of their dim glory.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They’re off!’ murmured Nixie. ‘It’s the first
flight. We <em>are</em> lucky!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Far overhead the pathways of fleecy cloud were
tinged with pale yellow as when the moon looks
sometimes mistily upon the earth—tinged, then
suddenly white and silvery as before.</p>

<p class='c011'>They collect—Paul drew upon the child’s account
for his Record—far over-seas upon some lonely strand
or headland, and then swarm inland, sometimes following
their companions, the birds, sometimes leading
them. In countless thousands they go, yet for all
their numbers never causing more than a passing
tremble of the air. Their armies add, perhaps, a
shadow to the night, a new tint to the clouds that
veil the moon; or, if owing to stress of autumn
weather, they start with the daylight, then the sunset
gains a strange new wonder that puzzles the heart
with its beauty, and makes unimaginative people
write foolish letters to the newspapers. Their speed
makes it difficult to catch even the slightest indication
of their flight; the sky is touched with glory, there
is a reflection in the river or the sea—and they are
gone! Or, perhaps, from the evergreens that stay
behind, often fringing the coast, the wind bears a
message of farewell, wondrous sweet; or some late
birds, delaying their own departure, wake in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>branches and sing in little bursts of passion the joy
of their own approaching escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when they return, each tree in the order of
its leaving, and according to its times and needs, they
bring with them all the essential glory of southern
climes, and the magic of spring is due as much to
the tales and memories they have collected to talk
about, as to the clear brilliance of the new dresses with
which they come to clothe their old bodies at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Record of the Aventure, as Paul wrote it
faithfully from the child’s description, makes curious
and instructive reading, and the loneliness of the
stalwart evergreens who remain behind to face the
winter brought a pathos into the tale that all lovers
of trees will readily appreciate, and may be read by
them in the published account.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet to Paul and Joan, to each according to
temperament and cast of mind, the little Aventure
brought thoughts of a more practical bearing. To
him, especially, in the escape of the tree-spirits—of
their ‘insides,’ as Nixie intuitively phrased it—he
divined an allegory of the temporary escape of
the little army of city waifs. Those boys, old in
face as they were cramped in body, had enjoyed, too,
a migration that clothed them for a time, outwardly
and inwardly, with some passing beauty which they
could take back to London with them just as the
trees come back with the freshness of the spring.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this thought led necessarily to others. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>little migration of their bodies from town was important
enough; but what of their minds and souls?
What chance of escape was there for these?</p>

<p class='c011'>The conclusions are obvious enough; they need
no elaboration. He had already learned from Joan
of their sufferings. His heart burned within him.
It was all mixed up in his queer poetic mind with
the swift vision of the Tree-Spirits, and with the
picture of Joan, Nixie, and the other children perched
like big berries in that astonished ilex tree. In due
season both berries and dreams must ripen. He was
beginning to see the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They’re gone already,’ Nixie interrupted his long
reverie in a whisper; ‘and to-night there’ll be great
rains to wash away all the signs. To-morrow morning,
you’ll see, half the trees will be bare.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And high in the heavens, incredibly high and
faint it seemed, ran the curious sweet sound, driven
farther and farther into the reaches of the night, till
at last it died away altogether.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Gone,’ murmured Joan, ‘gone!’ The beauty
of it touched her voice with sadness. ‘I wish we
could go like that—as beautifully, as quietly, as
easily!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Perhaps we do,’ Paul thought to himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I think we do,’ Nixie said aloud. ‘Daddy did, I’m
sure. I shall, too, I think—and then come back in the
spring, p’rhaps.’</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Very often in life, when the way seems all prepared
for joy, there comes instead an unexpected time of
sadness that makes all the preparation seem useless
and of no purpose. Those coloured threads, whose
ends and beginnings are not seen, weave this unexpected
twist in the pattern, and one knows the bitterness
that asks secretly, What can be the use of efforts
thus rendered apparently null and void at a single
stroke? forgetting the roots of faith that are thereby
strengthened, and shutting the eyes to the glory of
the whole pattern, which it is always the endeavour
of the imagination to body forth.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so it seemed to Paul a few weeks later when
he returned to England from America, where he had
been to settle up his affairs. For he had decided to
sever his connection with the Lumber Company, and
to devote his life henceforward to battling against the
wrongs and sufferings of childhood. The call had
come to him with no uncertain voice. Nixie had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>unintentionally sown the seeds; Joan had deliberately
watered them; his own liberated imagination
girded its loins to go forth as a labourer to the
harvest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, coming back with the joy of this approaching
labour in his heart, the veil of great sadness
descended upon his newly-opening life and set him
in the midst of a dreadful void, a blank of pain and
loneliness that nothing seemed able to fill. Nixie
went from him. The Hand that gilds the stars, and
touched her hair with the yellow of the sands, drew
her also away. Just when her gentle companionship
had justified itself for him as something ideally
charming that should last always, a breath of wintry
wind passed down upon that grey house under the
hill, and, lo, she was gone—gone like the spirit of
her little birch tree from the cruelties of December.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was in time to say good-bye—nothing more;
in time to see the awful shadow fall silently upon the
wasted little face, and to feel the cold of eternal
winter creep into the thin hand that lay to the last
within his own. Not a single word did he utter as
he sat there beside the bed, choked to the brim with
feelings that never yet have known the words to
clothe them. That cold entered his own heart too,
and numbed it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nixie it was that spoke, though she, too, said
little enough. The lips moved feebly. He lowered
his head to catch the last breath.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>‘I shall come back,’ he heard faintly, ‘just as the
trees do in the spring!’</p>

<p class='c011'>The voice was in his ear. It sank down inside
him, entering his very soul. For a moment it sang
there—then ceased for ever. With eyes dry and
burning, he buried his head in the tangle of yellow
hair upon the pillow, and when a moment later he
raised them again to speak the words of comfort to
his weeping sister, Nixie was no longer there to hear
him or to see.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I shall come back in the spring—just as the
trees do.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And so she died, leaving Paul behind in that sea
of loneliness whose waves drown year by year their
thousands and tens of thousands—the vast army that
know not Faith. Her blue eyes, so swiftly fading,
were on his to the last. It seemed to him that for a
moment he had seen God. And perhaps he had;
for Nixie assuredly was close to divine things, and
he most certainly was pure.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>Sad things are best faced squarely, very squarely
indeed; dealt with; and then—deliberately forgotten.
In this way their strength, and the beauty that
invariably lies within like a hidden kernel, may be
appropriated and their bitterness destroyed. But
such platitudes are easily said or written, and at first,
when Nixie left him, Paul felt as though the world
lay for ever broken at his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>What this elfin child had done for him must
appear to some exaggerated, to many, incredible;
for the relationship between them had somehow been
touched with the splendour and tenderness of a
world unknown to the majority. The delicate
intimacy between their souls, as between souls
of a like age, is difficult to realise outside the region
of fantasy. Yet it had existed: in her with a simple,
childlike joy that asked no questions; in him, with
an attempt at analysis that only made it closer and
more dear. What Paul had been to her was a secret
she had taken away with her; what she had been to
him, however, was to remain a most precious memory,
and at the same time a source of strength and happiness
that was to prove eternal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not, however, in the manner that actually came
about—and, at first, not realised by him in any
manner whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c011'>For, at first, he found himself alone, horribly
alone. What her little mystical heart of poetry had
taught him is hard to name. Expression, of course,
in its simpler form, and the joy of a sympathetic
audience; but more than that. In all fine women
lies hidden ‘the child’—the simple vision that pierces—and
perhaps in Nixie he had divined, and ideally
reconstructed for himself, the ‘fine woman’! Who
can say? A dream so rich and tender can never be
caught in a mere net of words. The truth lay
buried in the depths of his being, to strengthen and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>to bless; and some few others may divine its
presence there as well as himself perhaps. The only
thing he understood clearly at the moment was that
he had been robbed of an intimate little friend who
had crept into every corner of his heart, and that—he
was most terribly alone.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>There is nothing to be gained by dwelling upon
sadness; the details of Paul’s suffering may be left
to the imagination. It was characteristic of him that
he sought instinctively, and without cant, for the
Reality that lay behind his pain; and Reality—though
seas of grief may first be plunged through
to find it—is always Joy. For love is joy, and
joy is strength, and both are aspects of the
great central Reality of the life of the soul. The
child was so woven into the strands of his inmost
being that her going seemed, as it were, to draw out
with her these very strands—drew them out away
from himself towards—towards what? He hardly
knew how to name it. The word ‘God’ rarely
passed his lips: towards ‘Reality,’ then; towards
the deep things he had sought all his life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Part of himself, however, the child had taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>away with her. He passed more and more away
from the things of the world, though these had
never yet held him with any security in their mesh.
Nixie had gone ahead, that was all. Before long, as
years measure time at least, he would follow her.
She might even come back, ‘like the trees in the
spring,’ to tell him of the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>His great longing, unexpressed, had always been
to know something of the Beyond—to see into the
heart of things; not by the uninspired methods of
an unsavoury spiritualism, or the artificial forcing-house
of an audacious Magic; but by some inner,
as yet undetermined, way in his own heart. For he
had always clung to the secret belief that there must
be some interior way of finding ‘Reality,’ some
process, simple, piercing, profound, that would have
authority for himself, if not for all the world. In
the heart of all true mystics some such Faith is
ingrained. They are born with it. It is ineradicable—lived,
but rarely spoken.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the root of this belief it was that Nixie had
unknowingly watered and fed. Her going seemed
suddenly to have coaxed it almost into flower. His
need of the great, satisfying Companion that knows
no shadow of turning was incalculably quickened
thereby. Love and Nature were the veils that
screened the Beyond so thinly that he could almost
see through them; and to both these mysteries the
child had led him better than she knew.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>The energy of his mystical yearnings suddenly
increased a hundredfold. Whether these remain
within to poison, or go out to bless, depends, of
course, upon the nature of the heart that feels them.
Paul, fortunately for himself, had found ways of expression;
he was always provided now with the safety
of an outlet. And, for the immediate moment, the
path was clear enough, and very simple. He was to
comfort the mother that mourned her; himself that
mourned her; the puzzled little brother and sister,
and even the army of more or less disconsolate four-footed
friends that missed her presence vaguely, and
haunted the door of her room with the strange
instinct that there must still be caresses for them
within, and that for the moment she was merely
hiding.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Smoke, the furry black fellow, however,
always her favourite and his own, participant in all
their old Aventures, who brought him a strange
comfort by secret ways that no man understands.
For Smoke asked no questions. He knew; and
though he missed her in all their games, and meals,
and undertakings of every kind, in house or garden,
he showed no obvious symptoms of grief as a dog
might have shown. And sometimes he was positively
uncanny: he behaved almost as though he still saw
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>The others, however,——! With most of them
out of sight was out of mind. The kittens, now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>growing up, purred and played as of old in the
schoolroom, and the Chow puppies, China and
Japan, more like yellow puddings than ever, tore
about the house, tumbling and thudding, as though
they had never known their little two-legged elfin
playmate. The household dropped back into the
old routine; Margaret, sadder, less alive than before,
pressed down by her new grief into the semblance of
a vision; and the children, hushed and pale, but
gradually yielding to the stress of bursting life which
at that age has no long acquaintance with grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was winter, and the woods and gardens were so
altered that the usual corners of play and mischief
were unrecognisable. ‘Out-ov-doors’ was dead, the
sunshine unreal, the darkness hovering close even
on the clearest day. The haunts that Paul and Nixie
knew were too much changed, mercifully for him,
who often sought them none the less, to remind him
keenly. The little silver birch tree that danced in
summer before the skirts of the fir wood was bare
and shivering in the winds. Behind it, however,
unchanged and shaggy, still stood the dark sheltering
pine, steady among the blasts.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Paul, meanwhile, beyond the smaller sphere
of his immediate duties in the grey house under the
hill, took up with all the enthusiasm he could spare
from sorrow the work among the lost waifs. As has
been seen, he found the complete organisation ready
to hand. And, to his great satisfaction, he found, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>he became familiar with the detail, that it was work
suited to the best that was in him. He was the
right man in the right place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, it was Dick’s scheme, and to lose
himself in it was to get into touch again delightfully
with the great friendship of his youth. Nixie, too,
who had meant when she grew up to provide a
Wood for Lost Children, seemed ever pushing him
forward from behind. Thus his zeal never lessened,
and he lost himself in others to some purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>The test of time, of course, proved this. At the
moment, however, it can only be known by the trick
of ‘looking at the last chapter’—which is unlawful,
as well as logically impossible. And, before he got
so far, he had first learned another profound truth:
that only he who carries in his heart a great sorrow,
borne alone, can know the mystery of interior Vision,
inspiring and truly marvellous, which comes from a
blessing so singularly disguised as pain.</p>

<p class='c010'>The readjustment of self—the renewal—that follows
upon great bereavement having thus been faced
courageously, Paul threw himself into his work with
energy. Every Friday night he came down to the
house under the hill, and every Monday morning
he returned to London. But the details of the
work, beyond the fact that their fulfilment blessed
both himself and those for whom he laboured, are
not essential to the story of what followed. For the
history of Paul’s education is more than anything
else a history of Aventures of the inner life. Outwardly,
his existence was quiet and uneventful.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost immediately with the disappearance of
his little friend, for instance, he discovered that the
region through the Crack—the land betweenyesserdayandtomorrow—became
more real, more extraordinarily
real, than ever before. The entrances
now seemed everywhere and always close; it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>the ways of exit that were difficult to find. He
lived in it. Even in London he moved among
those fields of flowers, and the winter gloom that
depressed the majority only enhanced the bright
sunshine that lay about his path. His thoughts
were continually following the windings of the river
to the far horizon; and the horizon, too, was wider,
more enticing and mysterious, more suggestive than
ever of that blue sea beyond where he had sailed
with that other Companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The land became mapped out and known with
an intimacy that must seem little short of marvellous
to those who have never even dreamed of the
existence of so fair a country. For, the truth was,
his Companion, who was now his guide and leader,
had suddenly revealed herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>It came about a few days after the funeral—when
the emptiness and hush of sorrow that lay
over the house found its exact spiritual correspondence
in the silence and sense of desolation that filled
his own heart. He was in his bedroom, battling
with that loneliness in loneliness which at the first
had threatened to overwhelm him. He had just
left his sister’s side, having soothed her with what
comfort he could into the sleep of weariness and
exhaustion. By the open window, as so often
before, he stood, staring into the damp winter
night. Smoke moved restlessly to and fro behind
him, sometimes sitting down to wash, sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>jumping on the bed and sofa as though to search
for something it could never find. Mrs. Tompkyns,
who had scratched at the door a few minutes before,
for the first time in her life, and for reasons known
to none but herself and her black companion, lay at
last curled up before the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>The room was filled with a soft presence, once
silvery and fragrant, but now draped with the newly
woven shadows that rendered it invisible. The
invasion was irresistible. His heart ached. He
knew quite well that his own soul, too, was being
measured for its garment of shadow—garment that,
unlike ordinary clothes, fits better and closer with
every year. He was in that dangerous mood when
such measurements are made only too easily, and
the lassitude of grief accepts the trying-on with a
kind of soft, almost pleasurable, acquiescence—when,
sharply and suddenly, a sound was audible outside
the window that instantly galvanised him into a
state of resistance. The night, hitherto still as
the grave, sighed in response to a rising wind.
And through his being at the same moment ran
the answering little Wind of Inspiration some one
had taught him to find always when he sought it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the sound brought comfort. It was as
though an invisible hand had reached down inside
him and touched the source of joy!</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul turned quickly. Mrs. Tompkyns was awake
on the mat. Smoke rubbed against his legs. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>the table, where he had spread them a few minutes
before, were the black tie, the mended socks, the
unused bottle for nettle stings and scratches, and
beside them the faded spray of birch leaves, now
withered and shrivelled. And, as he looked, the
wind entered the room behind him, and he saw
that the brown branch turned half over towards
him. It rattled faintly as it moved. He was just
in time to rescue it from Smoke, who saw in the
sound and movement an invitation to play. He
pinned it out of reach upon the wall over the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was just as he finished, that this sound
of wind sighing through the dripping and leafless
trees outside was followed by another sound—one
that he recognised.... There was a rush
and a leap, a swift, whistling roar—and the next
second he found himself among the sunny fields
of flowers that he knew, and heard the water lapping
at his feet&#160;... through the Crack!</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Everybody’s thin <em>somewhere</em>,’ was what he almost
expected to hear; but what he did hear was another
sentence, followed by merry and delicious laughter:
‘Everybody can be happy somewhere!’</p>

<p class='c011'>And close in front of him, rising, it seemed,
out of the reeds and waves and yellow sands,
stood—that veiled Companion whom he knew to
be a part of himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was turned away from him so that he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>not see her face, yet he instantly divined a movement
of her whole body towards him. Something
within himself rushed out to meet her half-way.
His life stirred mightily. The thrill of discovery
came close. The next second his arms were
about her and she was looking straight into his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>But her own eyes were no longer veiled; her
laughing face was clear as the day; the figure that
he held so close was Nixie, child and woman. If
ever it can be possible for two beings to melt
into one, it was possible then. Each possessed the
other; each slipped into the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Face to face at last!’ he heard himself cry.
‘Bless your little fairy heart! Why in the world
didn’t I guess you sooner?’</p>

<p class='c011'>A flame of happiness sped through him, and
grief ran away utterly. The sense of loss that
had numbed his soul vanished. And when she
only answered him by the old mischievous laughter,
he asked again: ‘But how did you disguise yourself
so well—your voice, and everything——?
Even if your face <em>was</em> veiled I ought to have
recognised you! It’s too wonderful!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It was you who disguised me!’ she replied, standing
up close in front of him, and playing with
his waistcoat buttons as of old. ‘Your thoughts
about me got twisted—sometimes. You thought
too much. You should have <em>felt</em> only.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>‘They never shall again,’ he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘They never can. We are face to face now.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul turned to look again more closely. He saw
her with extraordinary detail and vividness. It was
indeed Nixie, but Nixie exactly as he had always
wanted her, without quite knowing it himself; at
least, without acknowledging it. No gulf of age
was there to separate them now. She was the
perfect Companion, for he had made her so. He
smoothed her hair as they turned to walk by the
river, and he caught the old childish perfume of it
as it spread untidily over his shoulder, her eyes like
dropped stars shining through it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Isn’t it awfully jolly?’ she whispered: ‘we can
have twice as many aventures now, and you can go
on writing them for Jonah and Toby just the same
as before, only faster.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He felt her hand steal into his; his heart became
most strangely merged with hers. He had known a
similar experience in Canadian forests, when the
beauty of Nature had sometimes caught him up till
he scarcely felt himself distinct enough from it to
realise that he was separate. He now knew himself
as close to her as that. It was exquisite and yet so
simple that a little child might have felt it—without
perplexity. Perhaps it was precisely what children
always <em>did</em> feel towards what they loved, animate or
inanimate.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But how is it you can come so close?’ he asked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>though he fancied that he thought, rather than
spoke, the question.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Because, in the important sense, you are still a
child,’ he caught the answer, ‘and always have been,
and always will be.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole world belonged to him. In the midst
of the sea of sorrow he had discovered the little
island of happiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We never can lose each other—<em>now</em>!’ he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘As long as you think about me,’ she answered.
‘Please always think hard, veryhardindeed thoughts.
Through the Crack you can find everything that’s
lost——.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And we’re through the Crack now.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Rather!’</p>

<p class='c010'>... It was only when the sky grew dark and
the shadow of clouds fell over that sunny landscape
that he realised he was still standing half dressed
beside a dying fire, and that through the open
window behind him the cold night air brought
discomfort that made him shiver. He drew the
curtains, lit a candle, spoke a soft word or two to
the curled—up forms of Mrs. Tompkyns and Smoke, who
were far too busy in their own Crack-land to
trouble about replying, and so finally got into bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>He felt happier, strangely comforted. The
wings of memory and phantasy, withdrawing softly,
left a soothed feeling in his heart. In that region
of creative imagination known as the ‘Crack’ he
always found peace and at least a measure of joy.
Until sleep should come to captain his forces, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>deliberately turned the current of his thoughts to the
work he was about to take up in London. Nixie,
Joan, Dick—all helped him. His will erected an
iron barrier against the insidious attacks of sadness—the
disease which strikes at the roots of effort. He
would dream his dreams, but also, he would do his
work....</p>

<p class='c011'>The shadows thickened about the house, crowding
from the heart of winter. The fire died down.
The room lay still. It was between one and two
o’clock in the morning, when silence in the country
is a real silence, and the darkness weighs. Chasing
Smoke and Mrs. Tompkyns down the winding
corridors of dream—Paul slept.</p>

<p class='c010'>A faint sound in the room a little later made him
stir in his sleep and smile. His lips moved, as
though in that land of dreams where he wandered
some one spoke to him and he answered. Then the
sound was repeated, and he woke with a start, sat
up in bed, and stared hard into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fire was quite out; nothing was visible but
the dim frame of the window on his right where he
had forgotten to draw the curtains. A glimmer of
light revealed the sash. Thinking it must be the
winter dawn, he was about to lie down again and
resume his slumbers, when the sound that had first
wakened him again made itself audible.</p>

<p class='c011'>A slight shiver ran down his spine, for the sound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>seemed to bring over some of the wonder of his
dreams into that dark and empty room. Then,
with a tiny revelation of certainty, the knowledge
came that he was wide awake, and that the sound was
close in front of him. Moreover, he knew at once
that it was neither Smoke nor Mrs. Tompkyns. It
was a sound, deliberately produced, with conscious
intelligence behind it. And it shot through him
with the sweetness of music. It was like a breath
of wind that rustled through a swinging branch—of
a birch tree; as though such a branch waved to and
fro softly above his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>His first idea was that some one was in the room,
and had taken down the spray of withered leaves
from the wall; and he strained his eyes in the direction
of the mantelpiece, trying to pierce the darkness.
In vain, of course. All he could distinguish was that
something moved gently to and fro like a spot of light—almost
like a fire-fly, yet white—about the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>From some deep region of sleep where he had
just been, the atmosphere of dream was still, perhaps,
about him. Yet this was no dream. There <em>was</em>
somebody in the room with him, somebody alive,
somebody who wished to claim his attention—who
had already spoken to him before he woke. He
knew it unmistakably; he even remembered what
had been said to him while yet asleep! ‘How <em>can</em>
you go on sleeping when I am here, trying to get
at you?’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>It was just as if the words still trembled on the air.
Confusedly, scarcely aware what he did, yet already
thrilling with happiness, his lips formed an answer:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Who are you? What is it you want?’</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a pause of intense silence, during
which his heart hammered in his temples. Then a
very faint whisper gathered through the darkness:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I promised....’</p>

<p class='c011'>The point of light wavered a little in the air, then
came low and seemed to settle on the end of the
bed. Into the clear and silent spaces of his lonely
soul there swam with it the presence of some one
who had never died, and who could never die.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Is that <em>you</em>——?’ The name seemed incredible,
for this was no Aventure through the Crack, yet
he uttered it after an imperceptible moment of
hesitation——‘<em>Nixie?</em>’</p>

<p class='c011'>Even then he could not believe an answer would
be forthcoming. The light, however, moved slightly,
and again came the faint tones of a voice, a singing
voice:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course it is!’ There was a curious suggestion
of huge distance about it, as though it travelled like
an echo across vast spaces. ‘I’m here, close beside
you; closer than ever before.’</p>

<p class='c011'>He heard the words with what can only be
described as a spiritual sensation—the peace and
gratitude that follow the passion of strong prayer,
of prayer that believes it will be heard and answered.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>‘You know <em>now</em>—don’t you?’ continued the
tiny singing voice, ‘because I’ve told you.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Yes,’ he answered, also very low, ‘I know now.’
For at first he could think of nothing else to say.
A huge excitement moved in him. Those invisible
links of pure aspiration by which the soul knits
herself inwardly to God seemed suddenly tightened
in the depths of his being. He understood that
this was a true thing, and possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You’ve come back—like the trees in the spring,’
he whispered stammeringly, after another pause,
gazing as steadily as he could at the point of clear
light so close in front of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The real part of me,’ she explained; ‘the real
part of me has come back.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The real part,’ he echoed in his bewilderment.
He began to understand.</p>

<p class='c011'>But even then it all seemed too utterly strange
and wonderful to be true; and a subtle confirmation
of the child’s presence that followed immediately only
added at first to his increasing amazement. For both
Smoke and Mrs. Tompkyns, he became aware, had
jumped up softly upon the foot of the bed, and were
sitting there, purring loudly with pleasure, close
beneath the fleck of light. And their action made
him seek the further confirmation of his own senses.
He leaned forwards, hesitating in his bewilderment
between the desire to find the matches and the desire
to touch the speaker with his hands.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>But even in that darkness his intention was divined
instantly. The light slid away like a wee torch
carried on wings.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘No, Uncle Paul,’ whispered the voice farther off,
‘not the matches. Light makes it more difficult for
me.’ He sank back against the pillows, frightened
at the reality of it all. The old familiar name, too,
‘Uncle Paul,’ was almost more than he could bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Nixie——!’ he stammered, and then found it
impossible to finish the sentence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she laughed. He heard her silvery laughter
in the room, exactly as he had heard it a hundred
times before, spontaneous, mischievous, and absolutely
natural. She was amused at his perplexity, at his
want of faith; at the absurd difficulty he found in
believing. He lay quite still, breathing hard,
wondering what would come next; still trying to
persuade himself it was all a dream, yet growing
gradually convinced in spite of himself that it
was not.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And don’t come too near me,’ he heard her
voice across the room. ‘Never try and touch me, I
mean. <em>Think of me at your centre.</em> That’s the real
way to get near.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Very slowly then, after that, he began to accept
the Supreme Aventure. He talked. He asked
questions, though never the obvious and detailed sort
of questions it might have been expected he would
ask. For it was now borne in upon him, as she said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>that only her <em>real</em> part had come back, and that only
<em>his</em> real part, therefore, was in touch with her. It
was, so to speak, a colloquy of souls in which physical
and material things had no interest. His very first
question brought the truth of this home to him with
singular directness. He asked her what the tiny
light was that he saw moving to and fro like a little
torch.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But I didn’t know there was a light,’ she
answered. ‘Where I am it is all light! I see you
perfectly. Only—you look so young, Uncle
Paul! Just like a boy! About my own age, I
mean.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And it is impossible to describe the delight, the
mystical rapture that came to him as he heard her.
The words, ‘Where I am it is all light,’ brought with
them a sudden sense of reality that was too convincing
for him to doubt any longer. From her simple
description he recognised a place that he knew. But,
at the same time, he understood that it was no <em>place</em>
in the ordinary sense of the word, but rather a <em>state</em>
and a <em>condition</em>. He himself in his deepest dreams
had been there too. That light had sometimes in
brief moments of aspiration shone for him. And the
curious sense of immense distance that came so
curiously with her tiny voice came because there was
really no distance at all. She was no longer conditioned
by space or time. Those were limitations
of life in the body, temporary scales of measurement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>adopted by the soul when dealing with temporary
things. Whereas Nixie was free.</p>

<p class='c011'>A sense of happiness deep as the sea, of peace,
bliss, and perfect rest that could never know hurry
or alarm, surged through him in a tide. He thought,
with a thrill of anticipation, of the time when his
own eyes would be opened, and he should see as
clearly as she did. But instantly the rebuke came.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh! You must not think about that,’ she said
with a laugh; ‘you have a lot to do first, a lot more
aventures to go through!’</p>

<p class='c011'>As she spoke the light slid nearer again and
settled upon the foot of the bed. His thoughts
were evidently the same as spoken words to her.
She knew all that passed in his mind, the very feelings
of his heart as well. This was indeed companionship
and intimacy. He remembered how she had told
him all about it in the Crack weeks ago, before he
realised who she was, and before he knew her face
to face. And at the same moment he noticed
another curious detail of her presence, namely, that
the little torch—for so he now called it to himself—in
passing before the mirror produced no reflection
in the glass. Yet, if his eyes could perceive it, there
ought to have been a refraction from the mirror as
well—a reflection! Did he then only perceive it
with his interior vision? Was his spiritual sight
already partially opened?</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s your ’terpretation of me—inside yourself,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>he caught her swift whisper in reply, for again she
<em>heard</em> his thought; and he almost laughed out aloud
with pleasure to notice the long word decapitated as
her habit always was on earth. ‘In your thoughts
I’m a sort of light, you see.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The explanation was delightful. He understood
perfectly. The thought of Nixie had always come
to him, even in earthly life, in the terms of brightness.
And his love marvelled to notice, too, that she still
had the old piercing vision into the heart of things,
and the characteristically graphic way of expressing
her meaning.</p>

<p class='c011'>The purring of the cats made itself audible. They
were both ‘kneading’ the bed-clothes by his feet,
as happy as though being stroked.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘No, they don’t see,’ she explained the moment
the thought entered his mind; ‘they only feel that
I’m here. Lots of animals are like that. It’s the
way dogs know ’sti’ctively if a person’s good or bad.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, how the animals after this would knit him to
her presence! No wonder he had already found
comfort with them that no human being could give....
The thought of his sister flashed next into his
brain—the difficulty of helping her——</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I tried to get at her before I came here to you,’
he heard, ‘but her room was all dark. It was like
trying to get inside a cloud. She’s cold and shadowy—and
ever such a long way off. It’s difficult to
explain.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>‘I think I understand,’ he whispered.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You can get closer than I can.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’ll try.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course. You must.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Nixie’s happiness that seemed so wonderful
and splendid to him. Her voice almost sang; and
laughter slipped in between the shortest sentences
even. Brightness, music, and pure joy were about
her like an atmosphere. He was breathing a rarefied
air, cool, scented, and exhilarating. He had already
known it when playing with the children and enjoying
their very-wonderful-indeed aventures; only now
it was raised to a still higher power. In its very
essence he knew it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Toby and Jonah are with me the moment they
sleep,’ she continued, ever following his least thought.
‘The instant their bodies fold up they shoot across
here to me. Toby comes easiest. She’s a girl, you
see. And Daddy’s here too——’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Dick?’ he cried, memory and affection surging
through him with a sudden passion.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course. You’ve thought about him so much.
He says you’ve always been close to each other——’</p>

<p class='c011'>The voice broke off suddenly, and the torch of
light moved to and fro as though agitated. Paul
heard no sound, and saw no sign, but again, into the
clear and silent spaces of his soul, now opened so
marvellously, so blessedly to receive, there swam the
consciousness of another Presence....</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>There was a long pause, while memory annihilated
all the intervening years at a single stroke....</p>

<p class='c011'>His mind was growing slightly confused with it
all. His mortal intelligence wearied and faltered a
little with the effort to understand how time and
distance could be thus destroyed. He was not yet
free as these others were free.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘How is it, then, that you can stay?’ he asked
presently, when the light held steady again. By
‘you’ he meant ‘both of you.’ Yet he did not say
it. This was what seemed so wonderful in their perfect
communion; words really were not necessary.
Afterwards, indeed, he sometimes wondered whether
he actually spoke at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I was going on—at first,’ came the soft answer,
‘when I heard something calling me, and found I
couldn’t. I had something to do here.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What?’ he ventured under his breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>You!</em>’ She laughed in his face, so to speak. ‘You,
of course. Part of you is in me, so I couldn’t go on
without you. But when you are ready, and have done
your work, we’ll go on together. Daddy is waiting,
too. Oh, it’s simply splendid—a very-splendid-indeed
aventure, you see!’ Again she laughed through that
darkened room till it seemed filled with white light,
and the light flooded his very soul as he heard her.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You <em>will</em> wait, Nixie?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I <em>must</em> wait. Both of us must wait. We are all
together, you see.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>And, after another long pause, he asked another
question:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This work, then, that keeps me here——?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Your London boys, of course. There’s no one
in the whole world who can do it so well. You’ve been
picked out for it; that’s what really brought you
home from America!’ And she burst out into such
a peal of laughter that Paul laughed with her. He
simply couldn’t help himself. He felt like singing at
the same time. It was all so happy and reasonable
and perfect.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You’ve got the money and the time and the
’thusiasm,’ she went on; ‘and over here there are
thousands and millions of children all watching you
and clapping their hands and dancing for joy. I’ve
told them all the Aventures you wrote, but they
think this is the best of all—the London-Boys-Aventure!’</p>

<p class='c011'>He felt his heart swell within him. It seemed
that the child’s hair was again about his eyes, her
slender arms clasping his neck, and her blue eyes
peering into his as when she begged him of old in the
nursery or schoolroom for an aventure, a story.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘So you’ll never give it up, will you, Uncle
Paul?’ she sang, in that tiny soft voice through the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Never,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Promise?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Promise,’ he replied.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>The thought of those ‘thousands and millions’
of children watching his work from the other side
of death was one that would come back to strengthen
him in the future hours of discouragement that he
was sure to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>And much more she told him besides. They
talked, it seemed, for ever—yet said so little. Into
mere moments—such was the swift and concentrated
nature of their intimacy—they compressed
hours of earthly conversation; for his thoughts were
heard and answered as soon as born within him, and
a whole train of ideas that the lips ordinarily stammer
over in difficult detail crowded easily into a single
expression—a thought, a desire, a question half
uttered, and then a reply that comprehended all.
There was no labour or weariness, no sense of effort.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, when at length he heard her faint
whisper, ‘Now I must go,’ it conveyed no sense of
departure or loss. She did not leave him. It was
more as though he closed a much-loved book and
replaced it in his pocket. The pictures evoked do
not leave the mind because the cover is closed; they
remain, on the contrary, to be absorbed by the heart.
Nixie’s silvery presence was <em>in him</em>; he would always
feel her now, even when his thoughts seemed busy
with outer activities.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little torch flickered and was gone; but as
Paul gazed into the darkness of the room he knew
that the light had merely slipped down deep into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>himself to burn as an unfailing beacon at the centre
of his soul. And then it was that he realised other
curious details for the first time. Some of the more
ordinary faculties of his mind, it seemed, had been
in suspension during the amazing experience, while
others had been exalted as in trance. For it now
came to him that he had actually <em>seen</em> her—with a
clearness that he had never known before. That
torch lit up her little form as a lantern lights up a
person holding it in darkness. Just as he had felt
all the sweet and essential points of her personality,
so also he had been vividly aware of her figure in
the terms of sight—eyes, hair, sunburned little hands,
and twinkling feet. Her very breath and perfume
even!</p>

<p class='c011'>If the working of his ordinary senses had been in
abeyance so that he hardly knew the hunger for
common sight and touch, he now realised that it was
because they had been replaced by these higher
senses with their keener, closer satisfaction. And
this intimate knowledge of her was as superior to the
ordinary methods as flying is to crawling—or, better
still, as a draught of water in the throat is to dipping
the fingers in the cup.</p>

<p class='c011'>For who, indeed, shall define the standard of
reality? And who, when the senses are such sorry
reporters, shall declare with authority that one thing
is false and could not happen, and another is true
and actually did happen?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Experiences of the transcendental order are,
perhaps, beyond the power of precise words to
describe, for they are not common enough to have
become incorporated into the language of a race.
And words are clumsy and inadequate symbols at
best. The deepest thoughts, as the deepest experiences,
ever evade them. It is difficult to convey
the sense of fierce reality the presence of Nixie
brought to him. It flooded and covered him;
spread through and over him like light; entered
into his essential being to cherish and to feed, just
as the body assimilates earthly nourishment. He
absorbed her. She nourished while she blessed him.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had told him the secret: <em>to think centrally</em>. He
now began to understand how much nearer he could
be to others by thinking strongly of them than by
walking at their side. Physical touch is distant
compared to the subtle intimacy of the desiring
mind. The mystical conception of union with God
came home to him as something practically possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet when he got up a few minutes later to write
down the conversation as he remembered it, the mere
lighting of the candle, the noise of the match, the
dipping of his pen in the ink—all contrived somehow
to bring him down to a lower order of things that
dimmed most strangely the memory of what had
just passed. Most of what he had heard escaped
him. He could not frame it into words. All he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>could recapture is what has been here set down so
briefly and baldly.</p>

<p class='c011'>It then seemed to him—the thought laboured to
and fro in his mind as he got back into bed and
sleep came over him—that it was only the Higher
Self in him that had been in communication with the
child. The eternal part of him had talked with the
eternal part of her. In the body, however, this was
commonly submerged. Her presence had temporarily
evoked it. It now had returned to its Throne at
the core of his being.</p>

<p class='c011'>All that he remembered of the colloquy was the
little portion that, as it were, had filtered through
into his normal self. The rest, the main part,
however, was not lost. He had absorbed it. If he
could not recall the actual words and language, he
understood—it was his last thought before sleep
caught him—that its <em>results</em> would remain for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>And those who have known similar experiences
will understand without more words. The rest will
never understand. Perhaps, after all, the best and
purest form of memory is—<em>results</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>And one of the clearest impressions that remained
next morning when he woke was that he had actually
<em>seen</em> her. The reality of it increased with the daylight
instead of faded. While he dressed he sang to
himself, until it occurred to him that his signs of
joy might be misunderstood by any of the household
who heard; and then he stopped singing and moved
about the room, smiling and contented.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something of the radiance of that little white
torch still seemed in the air. The heavy gloom of
the chill December morning could not smother it.
Something of it remained too about him all day like a
halo; looking out of his eyes; communicable, as it
were, from the very surface of his skin to all with
whom he came in contact. His sister, especially, and
the children felt the comfort of his presence. They
followed him about from room to room; they clung
close; they were instinctively aware that peace and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>strength emanated from him, though little guessing
the real source of his serene and tranquil atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c011'>For, of course, he told no one of what had
happened. During the day, indeed, it lay in him
submerged and unassertive, like the presence of some
great glowing secret, feeding the sources of energy
for all his little outward duties and activities, yet
never claiming individual attention itself. Only with
the fall of night, when the doings of the day were
instinctively laid aside like a garment no longer
required, did it again swim up upon him out of the
depths, and speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Now!’ he heard the tiny singing voice, ‘we can
be alone. Your body’s tired. I can get closer to
you.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’ve felt you by me all day, though,’ he said, as
though it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course,’ came the answering whisper, soft as
moonlight, ‘because I never left you for a single
moment. I was in everything you did—in your
very words. Once or twice, I even got into
mother too, <em>through you</em>, and made her feel better.
Wasn’t that splendid?’</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul longed to give the child one of his old hugs—to
feel her little warm and sunny body pressed
against his own. Instead, her laughter echoed
suddenly all about the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘That’s impossible now!’ he heard. ‘I’m ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>so much closer this way. You’ll soon get used to it,
you know!’</p>

<p class='c011'>This spontaneous laughter was the music to
which all their talks were set. He laughed too, and
blew the candles out.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I tried very hard to say the true things,’ he
murmured, referring to her remark about comforting
his sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I know you did. That’s how I got into her—through
you. You must go on and on trying. In
the end we’ll get her all soft and happy again. She’ll
feel me without knowing it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly it struck him that, although the room
was dark, he did not see the light of the little torch
as before. He missed it. He was just going to
ask why it was absent when the child caught his
thought and replied of her own accord:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Because it’s spread all over now, instead of being
just a point. You are in it, I mean. There’s light
everywhere about you now, and I see you much
clearer than last time.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The explanation described exactly what he felt
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Let them in, please,’ Nixie suddenly interrupted
his thoughts again. ‘They’re both coming up the
stairs. It was very naughty of you to forget them,
you know.’</p>

<p class='c011'>After a moment of puzzled hesitation he understood
what she meant, and was out of bed and across
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>the floor. He did not wait to light a candle, but
opened the door and stood there waiting in the
darkness. Almost at once two soft, furry things
brushed past his feet as Smoke, followed by Mrs.
Tompkyns, marched into the room, uttering that
curious sharp sound of pleasure which is something
between a purr and a cry. They disappeared among
the shadows beyond the fireplace, and Paul sprang
back into bed again pleased that they were there, yet
annoyed with himself for having forgotten them.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But it was my fault <em>really</em>,’ she laughed. ‘I’ve
been with them out in the garden, and they’ve only
just got in through the pantry window. My presence
excites them awfully. Oh, it’s all right,’ she added
quickly, in reply to his further thought; ‘Barker’s
very late to-night doing the silver. But he’ll shut
the window before he goes.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was his turn to laugh. She had caught his
thought about the window almost before it reached
the surface of his mind. Moreover, he found that
both Mrs. Tompkyns and Smoke had very cold wet
soles under their padded little feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this way, most strangely, sweetly, naturally,
even the trivial details of their daily life as they had
always known it together, intermingled with the talk
that was often very earnest, mystical, and pregnant
with meanings. It was in every sense a continuation
of their former relationship, touched on her side with
a greater knowledge—almost as though she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>suddenly developed to the point she might have
reached in time upon the earth; on his side, with
a delicate sense of accepting guidance from some one
with greater privileges than himself, who had come
back on purpose to help and inspire him.</p>

<p class='c011'>For more and more it seemed to partake of the
nature of genuine inspiration. Speech came direct
and swift as thought, without hesitation or stammering
as in the flesh. She told him many things, often
quaintly enough expressed, but that yet seemed to
hold the kernel of deep truths. There had never
been the least break in their companionship, it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I knew all this before,’ she said, after a singular
exchange of questions and answers about the nature
of communion with invisible sources of mood and
feeling, ‘only I suppose my brain had not got big
enough, or whatever it was, to tell it. Like your
poets you used to tell me about who couldn’t find
their rhymes, perhaps.’</p>

<p class='c011'>And her laughter flowed about him in a rippling
flood that instantly woke his own. They always
laughed. They felt so happy. It was a communion
between old souls that surely had bathed deeply in
the experiences of life before they had become imprisoned
in the particular bodies known as Paul
Rivers and Margaret Christina Messenger.</p>

<p class='c011'>He became convinced, too, more and more that
she really did not speak at all—that no actual sound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>set the waves of air in motion—but that she put her
words into him in the form of thoughts, and that he
it was, in order to grasp them clearly, who clothed
them with the symbols of sound and language. It
was essentially of the nature of inspiration. She
<em>blew</em> the ideas into his heart and mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>And many things that he asked her were undoubtedly
little more than his own thoughts, half-formed
and vague, lying in the depths of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then, over there, where you now are, is it—more
real? Are you, as it were, one stage nearer
to the great Reality? What’s it like——?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s through the real “Crack,” I think,’ she
answered. ‘Everything is here that I imagined—but
<em>really</em> imagined—on earth. And people who
imagined nothing, or wanted only the world, find
very little here.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then is the change very great——?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It doesn’t seem to me like a change at all. I’ve
been here before for visits. Now I’ve come to stay,
that’s all!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘You yourself have not changed?’</p>

<p class='c011'>She roared with laughter, till he felt that his
question was really absurd.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course not! How can I change? I’m
always Nixie, wherever I am!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But you feel different——?’ he insisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I feel better,’ she answered, still laughing. ‘I
feel awfully jolly.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>Then after a long pause he asked another question.
It was really a question he was always asking in one
form or another, only he had never yet put it so
directly perhaps. He whispered it from a grave and
solemn heart:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Are you nearer to—God, do you think?’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a word he rarely used. In his conversations
with the child on earth he had never once used
it. She waited a long time before replying. Instinctively,
very subtly, it came to him that she did
not know exactly what he meant.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I’m <em>in</em> and <em>with</em> Everything there is—Everywhere,’
she said softly. ‘And I couldn’t possibly be
nearer to anything than I am.’</p>

<p class='c011'>More than that she could not explain, and Paul
never asked similar questions again. He understood
that they were really unanswerable.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was the same with other thoughts, thoughts
referring to the fundamental conditions of temporal
existence, that is. Nothing, for instance, made time
and space seem less real than the way she answered
questions involving one or other. Out of curiosity
he had gone to the trouble of reading up other
records of spirit communion—the literature (saving
the mark) of Spiritualism brims over with them—and
he had asked her some question with regard to the
detailed geography there given.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But there’s no <em>place</em> at all where I am,’ the child
laughed. ‘I am just <em>here</em>. There was no place really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>in our Aventures, was there? Place is only with
you on earth!’</p>

<p class='c011'>And another time, talking of the ‘future’ when
he should come to join herself and Dick at the close
of his earthly pilgrimage, she said between bursts
of the merriest laughter he had ever known: ‘But
that’s now! already! You come; you join us; we
<em>are</em> all together—always!’</p>

<p class='c011'>And when he insisted that he could not possibly be
in two places at once, and reminded her that she had
already told him she was ‘waiting’ for his arrival,
the only reply he could get was this jolly laughter,
and the assurance that he was ‘awfully muddled and
c’fused’ and would ‘never understand it <em>that</em> way!’</p>

<p class='c010'>The main thing these ‘silent’ conversations taught
him seemed to be that Death brings no revolutionary
change as regards character; the soul does not leap
into a state much better or much worse than it knew
before; the opportunities for discipline and development
continue gradually just as they did in the body,
only under different conditions; and there is no
abrupt change into perfection on the one hand, or
into desolation on the other. He gathered, too, that
these ‘conditions’ depended very largely upon the
kind of life—especially the kind of thought—that
the personality had indulged on earth. The things
that Nixie ‘imagined’ and yearned for, she found.</p>

<p class='c011'>His communion with her became, as time passed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>more frequent and more real, and soon ceased to
confine itself only to the quiet night hours. She was
with him all day long, whenever he needed her.
She guided him in a thousand unimportant details of
his life, as well as in the bigger interests of his work
in London with his waifs. And in murky London
she was just as close to him as in the perfumed
stillness of the Dorsetshire garden, or in the retirement
of his own chamber....</p>

<p class='c011'>And one singular feature of their alliance was
that it continued even in sleep. For, sometimes, he
would wake in the morning after what had been
apparently a dreamless night, yet later in the day
there would steal over him the memory of a long
talk he had enjoyed with the child during the hours
of so-called unconsciousness. Dreams, forgotten in
the morning, often, of course, return in this fashion
during the day. There is nothing new or unusual in
it. Only with him it became so frequent that he
now rose to the day’s work with a delightful sense of
anticipation: ‘Perhaps later in the day I shall remember!
Perhaps we have been together all night!’</p>

<p class='c011'>And in this connection he came to notice two
things: first, that after these nights together, at first
forgotten, he woke wonderfully refreshed, blessed,
peaceful in mind and body; and secondly, that what
recalled the conversation later was always contact
with some object or other that had been associated
with the child. Thus—the picturesquely-mended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>socks, the medicine bottle for scratches, or the spray
of birch leaves, now preserved between the pages of
his Blake, never failed in this latter respect.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was curious, too, how the alliance persisted and
fortified itself during the repose of the body; as
though, during sleep, the eternal portion of himself
with which the child communed, enjoyed a greater
measure of freedom. It recalled the closing lines of
a sonnet he had always admired, though his own
experience was true in a literal sense hardly contained,
probably, in the heart of the poetess:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But when sleep comes to close each difficult day,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When night gives pause to the long watch I keep,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And all my bonds I needs must loose apart,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Must doff my will as raiment laid away—</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>With the first dream that comes with the first sleep</em></div>
      <div class='line in4'><em>I run, I run, I am gathered to thy heart.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>He filled a book with these talks as the years
passed, though to give them in more detail could
serve little purpose but to satisfy a possible curiosity.
They had value and authority for himself, but for
the majority might seem to contain little sense, or
even coherence. They expressed, of course, his own
personal interpretation of life and the universe. And
this was quite possibly poetic, queer, fantastic—for
others. Yet it was his own. He had learned his
own values in his own way, and was now engaged
in sorting them out with Nixie’s fairy help to
guide him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>And all souls that find themselves probably do
likewise. The strength and blessing they shed about
them as a result is beneficial, but the close details of
the process by which they have ‘arrived’ can only
seem to the world at large unintelligible, possibly
even ridiculous; and this late interior blossoming
of Uncle Paul, though it actually happened, must
seem to many a tissue of dreams knit together with
a strange fantastic nonsense.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>And thus, as the region where he met and held
communion with the freed child seemed to draw
deeper and deeper into his interior being, the reality
and value of the experience increased.</p>

<p class='c011'>That there was some kind of definite external
link, however, was equally true; for the cats, as well
as certain other of the animals, most certainly were
aware sometimes of her presence. They showed it in
many and curious ways. But it was distinctly a shock
to Paul to learn one day from his sister that queer
stories were afoot concerning himself; that some of
the simple country folk declared they had seen ‘Mr
Rivers walking with a young lady that was jest like
Miss Nixie, only taller,’ who disappeared, however,
the moment the observer approached. And the way
the household felt her presence was, perhaps, not
less remarkable, for more than one of the servants
gave notice because the house had become ‘haunted,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>and there had been seen a ‘smallish white figure, all
shiny and dancing,’ in his bedroom, or going down
the corridor towards his study.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps the glamour of his vivid creative thought
had cast its effect upon these untrained imaginations,
so that his vision was temporarily communicated to
them too. Or, perhaps, they had actually seen what
they described. But, whatever the explanation may
be, the effect upon himself was to increase, if that
were possible, the reality of the whole occurrence....</p>

<p class='c011'>And when the spring came round again with its
charged memories of perfume, and sight, and the
singing of its happy winds; when the tree-spirits
returned to their garden haunts, all flaming with the
beauty of new dresses gathered over-seas; when the
silver birch tree combed out her glittering hair to
the sun and shook her leaves in the very face of that
old pine tree—then Paul felt in himself, too, the
rejuvenation that was going forward in all the world
around him. He tasted in his heart all the regenerative
forces that were bursting into form and energy
with the spring, and knew that the pain and desolation
he had felt temporarily in the winter were only
spiritual growing-pains and the passing distress of a
soul forging its way outwards through development
to the best possible Expression it could achieve.</p>

<p class='c011'>For Nixie came back, too, gay and glorious like
the rest of the world—sometimes dressed in blossoms
of lilac or laburnum, sometimes with skirts of daisies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>and feet resting upon the Little Winds, sometimes
with the soft hood of darkness over her head, the
cloak of night about her shoulders, the stars caught
all shivering in her hair, and dusk in the deeps of
her eyes....</p>

<p class='c011'>His life became ‘inner’ in the best sense—a Life
within a Life; not given over to useless dreaming,
but ever drawing from the inner one the sustenance
that provided the driving force for the outer one:
the mystic as man of action!</p>

<p class='c011'>The Wind of Inspiration blew for him now always,
and steadily; but it was no longer the little wind
that stirred the measure of his personal emotion into
stammering verse, but the big, eternal wind that
‘blew the stars to flame,’ and at the same time
impelled him irresistibly along the path of High
A’venture to the loss of Self in work for others....</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then why is it we are in the body—and spend
so much time there?’ he asked in one of those
intimate and mysterious conversations he held with
the child to the very end of his life. ‘Why need
the soul descend to such clumsy confinings?’</p>

<p class='c011'>For their talk was very close now about ‘real
things,’ and neither found any difficulty in the words
of question or answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘To get experience that can only be got through
the pains of limitation,’ the answer sang within him,
as he lay there upon the lawn beneath the cedars,
absorbing the spring beauty. ‘Everything is doing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>the same thing everywhere—from Smoke, Mrs.
Tompkyns and Madmerzelle, right up to you, me,
Daddy, and the waifs! They all have a bit of
Reality in them working upwards to God. Even
stones and plants and trees are learning experiences
they could learn only in those particular forms—’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I know it! Of course, I know it!’ Paul
interrupted, with a rush of joy in his heart he could
not restrain; ‘but go on and tell me more, for I
love to hear your little voice say it all.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It’s only, perhaps, that the stones are learning
patience and endurance; the flowers sweetness; the
trees strength and comfort; and the rivers joy.
Later they change about, so that in the end each
‘Bit of Reality’ has gathered all possible experiences
in nature before it passes on into men and women.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Think, Uncle Paul, of the joy of a stone, who
after centuries of patience and endurance, cramped
and pressed down, knows suddenly the freedom of
wind and sea! Of the restlessness of flame that,
after ages of leaping unsatisfied to the sky, learns
the repose of a tree, moved only by the outside
forces of wind and rain! And think of the delight
of all these when they pass still further upwards
and reach the stage of consciousness in animals and
men—and in time enter the region of development
where I—where you and I, and all we knew and
loved, continue together, ever climbing, fighting,
learning——’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>It was curious. Afterwards he could never
remember the way she ended the sentence. For
the life of him he could not write it down. Definite
recollection failed him, together with the loss of the
actual words. Only the general sense remained in
such a way as to open to his inner eye a huge vista
of spiritual endeavour and advance that left him
breathless and dizzy when he contemplated it, but
at the same time charged most splendidly with
courage and with hope.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then the pains of limitation,’ he remembered
asking, ‘the anguish of impossible yearnings that
vainly seek expression—these are symptoms of growth
that in the end may produce something higher
and nobler?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Must!’ he heard the answer amid a burst of
happy laughter, as though from where she stood it
were possible to look back upon earthly pangs and
see them in the terms of joy; ‘just like any other
suffering! Like the stress of heat and pressure
that turns common clay into gems——’</p>

<p class='c011'>He interrupted her swiftly, high hopes crowding
through his spirit like the rush of an army.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then the life in us all—the “Bits of Reality” in
you and me—have passed through all possible forms
in their huge upward journey to reach our present
stage——?’ He stammered amid a multitude of
golden memories, half captured.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of course, Uncle Paul, of course!’ he caught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>deep, deep within him the silvery faint reply. ‘And
your love and sympathy with trees, winds, hills, with
all Nature, even with animals’—again her laughter
ran out to him like a song—‘is because you passed
long ago through them all, and <em>half remember</em>. You
still <em>feel with</em> them, and your imagination for ever
strives to reconstruct the various beauty known in
each stage. You remember in the depths of you the
longings of every particular degree—even of the
time when your soul was less advanced, and groping
upwards as your London waifs grope even now. This
is why your sympathy with them, too, is deep and
true. You <em>half remember</em>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And Death,’ he whispered, trembling with the
joy of infinite spiritual desire.</p>

<p class='c011'>The answer sank down into him with the Little
Wind that stirred the cedars overhead, or else rose
singing up from the uttermost depths of his listening
heart—to the end of his days he never could tell
which.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What you call Death is only slipping through the
Crack to a great deal more memory, and a great deal
more power of seeing and telling—towards the
greatest Expression that ever can be known. It is, I
promise you faithfully, Uncle Paul, nothing but a
very-wonderfulindeed Aventure, after all!’</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
